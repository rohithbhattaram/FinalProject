Can rarely get app to open due to poor internet service by AT&T. When I can open it it always wants me to link accounts which I've already done! All I want to do is pay my bill! Not go thru the same garbage every time I get this stupid app opened! Linking accounts should be an optional thing the customer is actually looking to do instead of the road block it is! Please! Just let me pay my bill since you charge to pay by phone and I did as I was asked and downloaded your app!,negative

"The app was working, but it doesn""t no more.",negative
"most of the time, when trying to access features like internet plan change, it shows the touch but never goes to the feature. also hate that i can't change my DirecTV plan.

It can be a little confusing at first with all the different option.

How do you create an account app that doesn't allow access to your account. Password system does not work.

"I am unable to access my account through this app. I am unsure whether this is a failure of the app or poor SERVICE from ATT. I believe that it is poor service from ATT as their prepaid web service is also of little use. The app does advise you to call 611, which does work. I reccommend you register 611 in your contact list and forget about this crappy app. I expected more from a tech company. Shame on you ATT.",negative

I still have the issues that were supposedly fixed. This app still sucks !,negative

Extremely limited for anything but paying bill online.,negative

"Last two months, I've gotten on the app, and it says it isn't working, and to try later. Last month, I had to change my password, and this month, I couldn't pay my bill on time, because the app wouldn't work, had to go into a store the next day to make my payment.

your wireless service sucks. phone says 5G runs like 2G.,negative
Got further than most on the app. Started a chat about a service I declined upon starting directv and finally when I got to chat supposedly to a human...... Guess what? They were able to chat but I couldn't type at all. Why is it everytime I get Directv I get a sports package charged to my I account that I specifically said multiple times I did not want. I setup autopay and low and behold I've been charged for months for a Regional Sports Package that I declined before they even asked. TYPICAL!,negative
Ridiculous! The AT&T app is suddenly a train wreck! I can no longer look at my DirecTV statement because of the stupid way the DirecTV website is set up now that it's a part of AT&T. The AT&T app works okay if all you want to do is look at AT&T stuff but somebody with some internet savvy needs to fix this mess with DirecTV.,negative
sucks,negative

AT&T has killed everything good about DirecTV. We will be cancelling service as many others are doing.,negative

The app is as useless as AT&T service itself. Usually times itself out do to poor quality reception. Wish they would get 3G service out here!! claiming they are going to 5G?! Can't even get 4G!! Laughable service and disappointing app.,negative
service is the worst.,negative

this is officially the slowest & most unreliable app I've ever used & I've been using it for a good many years I would've thought by now with the technology as advanced as it is tht AT&T would've done updated it to run better than any other app but no it's the opposite it just gets worse & worse,negative
"the app works ,I love how the ATT reps say use the app for your needs and it's a misleading statement",positive
not good. I want to visit my cell account for incoming calls from January 2019,negative
SLOW ... waiting for info from this app is a trial in patience. Since this area of the world is .....or not or never will be.... part of ATT Fiber we are in a twilight zone of DSL. You are allowed 150 gigs a month. Go over and you pay extra. So I like to keep tabs on my usage. Using this app for that purpose is a hit or miss process where ...sometimes.... you can get to the USAGE page to see what you racked up in gigs to date....but not ALWAYS. At times its not possible!! And A hassle.,negative
muy dificl ingresar 😩,negative
cant pay online because it says system error very disappointed I have to call 611,negative

it sucks unable to access my account therefore unable to pay my bill,negative
I have been trying to look at my specific usage for two weeks and get nothing. It works sometimes. Other times not at all. All I get is that mobile data is being used. No specific numbers are listed so I can't see who is calling or texting us. I hate when things don't work all the time.You would think ATT would supply a better app. They have no problem taking my money when I pay my bill through the app. Get this thing working right!,negative

I haven't been able to pay my bill through the app in 2 months.,negative

AT@T refuses to investigate and reconcile discreptences re billing my account. AT@T has given me at least three different amounts and by their own words threatened to shut off uverse and internet. I have recorded every call and posess every written bill. I'd be stupid to pay without a clear explanation. The ball is now in AT@T's court.,negative

terrible service and have to reset my phone daily to even use it. dropped calls are daily. do not buy this garbage go straight talk. I have a daily battle getting service and 90% of customer service people are foreign and cant fix an issue. Save your money. go elsewhere. If I could rate these jokers any lower I would. they are the worst. get you in a contract and extort you and dont fix problems. they also sell your info so be prepared for at least 10 spam calls daily.,negative
the worst ever.,negative
I can't get into the app to pay my bill. Probably gonna pay off my account and go with another phone company,negative

kind of a bad experience,negative
Single worst app I have ever been forced to use. ATT has permanently lost my business due to their total lack of customer service. See you all at the Verizon store.,negative
Half the time I can't see my text message usage on the app. I can see the data usage and the calls but not the text.,negative

usless as their website. youd think that a company that is based on technology could make it more user friendly so i dont have to change my password every single time i pay my bill,negative
since I've had the phone I have not been able to log on to it whatsoever I type in my username and my password and it does the whole loading thing and then goes right back to the screen and I know that that's the correct password. I never had this problem with the T-Mobile app,negative
slow and cumbersome,negative
Only useful for limited use. Most of the time I call rather than try to use the app. About the only thing I do is check my balance and pay the bill. I call for everything else. It's not a user friendly app .,negative
Appalling service from bi-lingual monkeys too stupid to bill you on the day you asked them to 3 times in a 3 month period because they don't understand English worth a damn!,negative
"Edited 6/26/19 they made both their website and app a BILLION TIMES WORSE by mandating a text to the phone assigned to the account. What if the phone is dead, broken, lost or left elsewhere? It's absolutely ludicrous that a company this large has no commitment to alternative login abilities. Their customer service is apologetic but ultimately unhelpful. Be very wary prospective customer. You have been warned!",negative

Sight does not open about 75% of the time.,negative
pretty useless. Not sure why anyone would use it.,negative
"While it once was passably functional the app no longer updates account info in real time, and if you try loading it the thing just shows a loading indicator which never goes away. What's the point of having an app to pay your bill, monitor your services use, etc. when the question of whether or not it'll deign to actually do what it's designed to has an unpredictable answer?",negative
garbage bloatware,negative
the app is never current,negative
beats calling AT&T and speaking to someone I can't understand,negative

Can't check account. Just keeps spinning. WILL NOTet me see current bills. EVER no matter what device. BUT YOU CAN OPEN AFTER YOU PAY FOR CHARGES YOU NEVER DESERVED.,negative
Your company sucks ass. Your customers should sue you for scamming them.,negative
this app never works when you need technical support. att don't offer this if you can't do it and keep kicking me out of the app. If i can rate you a zero i would.,negative

Slow. Difficult to use.,negative

bad company every......,negative
Can never get in. Have spent literally hours on the phone with technical team,negative
"When it works :/... might as well delete it and just use the internet on my phone tho tbh. UPDATE: It somehow got even worse. lol Now you login, and then you have to ""confirm it's really you"" by requesting a text code to your phone. When you hit ""send code,"" then the code never even shows up... smh",negative
"crappy, poorly designed, slow, baggy",negative
"Would like to pay a bill - why is that not super easy to do?? No one to call, at a phone company? What's the difference between adding an ID & creating an ID? Does it matter? I was not permitted to do either . . .",negative
"This stupid app sends me text messages at 7am in the morning saying, ""you have 1 or more bill alerts"". The billing office is not even open at 7am. Further more I have auto pay on my account so the bill is never overdue. And if the alert is to tell me my next bill is available for review, why would it notify me before 8AM. It is annoying and it is pissing me off. This seems like an easy fix.",negative
"seeing the bill amount is the only useful thing about this app. if you want to make changes to your account or services, calling is the only way. Calling is useless also!",negative
"One of the most buggy and unintuitive apps I've ever had the misfortune of having to use. AT&T, I recommend you fire your entire mobile app division, especially the UX engineers, and start from scratch.",negative
no vale verga,negative

everytime I want to reset my pw it only does one account and messes up all three accounts.,negative
Not sure why even have the app if it is just going to redirect me to the website to log in all over again.,negative
fair,negative
too slow and difficult to get where you want to go,negative
"I've been with Verizon, T Mobile and now AT&T. AT&T by far has the worst data connection. The difference is like landline vs Cable. It's like 1990's Motorola to Samsung 10. It's like a train running on coal vs Cal Train. It's incredible how bad it is.",negative
It is as bad as calling customer service,negative
ever time i try to put in my password it does not work so i ask for a new one and it still will not let me on to pay my bill. it sucks,negative

great when it works. more often than not it says unavailable,negative
"Every time I open the app, it says it is having trouble or just a minute. push me towards paperless billing and then the app and the web site doesn't work either.",negative

Started out good now not so. I have loved how i can check my data usage. I have noticed over the last few months it doesn't stay up to date on how much data is being used. So bad i try to not to go over the data amount and go over cause it doesn't stay up-to-date. I understand there maybe a lag in time but this isn't the case. As of today7/23/19 it is even updated at all back to 215gb(fixed wireless).,negative

"the speed suck, they came out said they fixed the problem and it's still slow",negative
"have to constantly change password, it's like it doesn't store it or remember me every time I log in.... other than that it's very useful",negative
this app used to work perfectly. now it continually goes to home screen.,negative
Keeps taking my internet option off of the opening screen. That's where you can see who is using the wi fi...,negative
Why do I keep having to use your ID &member Id.,negative
app is very complicated. i go to check my bill and it takes me to the beginning.,negative
this app NEVER WORKS!!!!,negative
Too unknow app claiming to be legal. I am cautious.,negative

never works.,negative
"una porquería, nunca pude hacer el pagó, ni en ingles ni en español 👎",negative
takes too long to load and only works when it feels like. Trouble logging too many times.,negative

"This app is horrible. Get constant error messages when trying to log in. Have fingerprint and password set up. End up having to call to pay bill constant problems with that. updates have not fixed the recurring problems with log in. uninstalled and reinstalled 3x now and it's still messed up. Reading other reviews, I'm not the only one that is having continuous problems with this app. Your developers need to fix the problem. the app as it is, is completely useless!",negative
this app has been locked for 6 months between my attempts and DirecTV. it stinks,negative
I don't want direct tv!!!,negative
sucks,negative
Throws errors. Not clear how to change password when you know your password.,negative
"Absolutley dumb that I have to use my data to update a broken ATT app in order to check my data usage. In addition, the app uses a ton a data loading pages and info. You would think they would make it light weight and blazing fast to help improve the brand, but who cares about brand value when the government has given you a legal monopoly, right?",negative
"When I try to sing in don't let me pass to the next step, preventing me to continue.",negative
thought this app should be more user-friendly,negative
This app needs a major overhaul. It shouldn't take twenty minutes to pull up a phone bill on four bars of 4G. At&T has tried changing this app several times in the past without improving anything. This app is the main reason why I'll be switching phone carriers at the end of this contract.,negative
i hate that AT&T has taken over Ditectv. you have messed up my login for my ATT prepaid account. You need to fix this now or i will take my service elsewhere,negative

when i try to sign in to pay a bill it directs me to an internet page that sayhs the system is down. this has been going on for me for the last 3 or more months. i don't see the point of the app if i have to call to make payments every month.,negative
"It is an almost constant frustration just signing in, much less navigating to the different categories within the app.....of any app on my phone, or any I have ever had, it is the worst. It can take several minutes to update my cureent information, if it will do it at all, without signing out and signing in. One would think that the nation's premier phone company would do better....the sad thing is, the services available therein are adequate, if not superb, if I could only use them",negative
I'm rarely able to access my account. I've tried restarting my phone. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It does nothing but buffer after login.,negative

Seriously thinking about changing my carrier. my connection is getting sluggish more times than not. 4G is more like 2g at times. AT&T prepaid used to rock but not now.

useless - I logged in 5 times before I finally gave up trying to get support,negative
this app is trash just like att it never works right their information is never accurate. the online chat help is trash they will say one thing and it will not reflect on your bill. I've been paying for free phones for six months they keep saying they're going to fix it and credit my account and it hasn't happened. DO NOT SWITCH TO ATT I've taken screen shots and they still won't honor anything. att is the worst and direct TV if i could give 0 stars i would they don't deserve any,negative
"I hate this new app. It used to be brainless to log in, one or two taps. Now I launch the app and I'm in a shopping website first thing, shopping tabs all work, but managing account tab does not (coincidence?). I would appreciate having sign in placed up front and center again, and not see all this shopping bull before anything else.",negative
my att app keeps telling me system error.,negative
"Don't bother, go to a corporate store. This app is good for checking your bill and window shopping for devices/accessories. Don't try ordering anything or paying your bill. Corporate store employees are almost always helpful, knowledgeable professionals.",negative
"Just a continuous circle of login loops. I'm about done with ATT. They have not honored my free HBO, this app is horrible, and their customer service is just awful.",negative
Glitchy. Takes multiple attempts to login. I just wanna pay my bill!,negative
"app just doesn't work well, sign in wont take me to the main page, keeps telling me ID is invalid. I just use my laptop to look at billing. phone app sucks",negative
used to be easy to use. now complicated,negative
Liars,negative
"Slow, unresponsive app that makes making payments a giant hassle. Almost as garbage as their website.",negative
won't show my data usage for some reason,negative
More of an app based storefront than account management app. ugh,negative
"Loved to use this app to pay my bill and do other things. Has stopped working altogether. Won't go to login page, can't click on payment page, and takes me to broken links. Not happy with it all.",negative
"Update to app has rendered it useless. As noted by other reviewers, Manage My Account link doesn't open. Hey AT & T, if I can't get in the app, then I can't pay my bill.",negative
Lately not allowing me to login. Very annoying.,negative
"GARBAGE app since the redesign. Previous iterations of the app have never been great, much less pleasing to use, but they did fulfill their function. AT&T, you're not obligated to provide an acct mgmt app. Instead of lying to your customers, feigning desire to serve them, remove the acct mgmt references and rebrand the app as a sales tool.",negative
Am not able to change anything like services or packages through app as advertised. Not sure why the update even happened since it made it worse.,negative
it stop working,negative
I can't even get in to set a pass code REALLY!!!!!! Get a real person on the phone guys.,negative

Made a payment plan that was cancelled through the app for 6/29/19 and was not notified it wasnt acceptable. Account was suspended.,negative
horrible....sometimes i get my dtv account sometimes my att account. when i get my att account i can't access my usage. contract is up so cancelling account.,negative
"The latest update is an absolute joke. There is no way yo manage your account anymore, that service has been gutted. The only working parts are to sell you more att services. Disgusting.",negative
App never works!,negative
too much repeating of trying to get in your own account. Putting in a password out the password of the password doesn't really make sense!,negative
It won't let me sign in at all. I even tried to reset my password. It kept saying not valid password. please fix it!!!!!,negative
"You people ruined this app , it was perfectly good and simple and easy to use now it is so screwed up and locks your account, or it tells you you don't have an account, it won't let you into billing, it won't let you make payments, it is useless, been an ATT customer for 30 years , but I think its time to talk to Verizon !!!!!!",negative
This app is horrible! Most of the time it doesn't work!,negative
"Worst app ever. It never works. Every time I try to use it, there is a message in the app that ""we are sorry but thet information is unavailable at this time. please try later. Why even have an app if they never have the data available.",negative
horrible app! Any technical questions plan on waiting 60 minutes to speak to someone who you can't understand in a different country!,negative
Download took way too long!,negative
"not so good experience, too bushy. No easy way to directly access the information needed. Can be way better",negative
What is the point of using biometrics if I have to enter a password every time? Also once logged in I can't interact to manage my account.,negative
That extra step is still there. No access to my account online for months. I'm ashamed to say I have AT&T as a carrier. But I won't for much longer.,negative
"Not only the app but all att is horrible, I don't know how to say or explain my situation that since i moved with att it's been a nightmare and nobody help me in any way of communication I'm so stressed because of them. I'll try to go away once I finish paying what I did not bought and never come back if you see my coment please don't go with them.",negative
unable to get the app to recognize the fact that we have no reception inside our home. Totally useless app and a waste of my time!!,negative
"Sometimes works sometimes doesn't. Great for viewing usage and bills, but device management fails miserably when trying to add or upgrade a device.",negative
sucks just like there services,negative
Its decent when it works. I haven't been able to sign in for over a month. Customer service says to wait a little bit and try again. Still doesn't work. Very frustrating!,negative
No user friendly.,negative
the app sucks it's hard to sign on so I can pay my bill. it just advertises stuff.,negative
not user friendly,negative
too hard to figure out keeps looping and does nothing,negative
keeps freezing up. uninstall and reinstall. never works! POS!,negative
i dont really understand the whole jist of the app itself?,negative
"This ""app"" is a glorified website. It works about as well as using the in-browser site, and is presented in an equally bland and awkward way. I can honestly say I expected a lot more from a tech company. The best that can be said is that it does what you need it to, assuming you've got the patience to sit there and wait for it. Aside from that, it's very slow, very ugly, and very disappointing.",negative
I just want an app with nothing other than billing-related material. No one wants anything else. Just stahp.,negative
"ATT for what it cost isn't that good. We have the internet, home phone service, direct tv and cell service. Its not that good for the money.",negative
hard to get into,negative
This app suck...its slower than slower,negative
sadly and sorely disappointed with the way the screw loyal customers.The app is fine but the company as a whole and all their HIDDEN policies are just plain dispicable. Hope nobody else gets hosed like i did by this place.,negative
"If I could give zero stars, I would. I just want to pay my bill. !! The app won't update because I don't have enough space. I don't understand why it needs access to all my photos, media files and accounts, and my location. ?! I tried logging into the website, and it won't take my login information. ATT how irritating!!!!",negative
impossible to get help .,negative
"Of course some info about me is necessary, however when I answer all your questions to set up account, manage my bill,etc. you guys keep asking questions that seem to me are nothing but info/""trading cards"" for other companies, I am simply trying to set up my account, & haven't been able to,... just want privacy and simplicity",negative
ehhh,negative
cant get into app all constant errors,negative
"app sucks, it don't let me sign in. i been a customer for at least five years now...",negative

"This app never works properly. More frequently than not, the App says my password is incorrect. I'm constantly having to reset the password. After resetting the password, the app won't recognize the new password till a later time (usually 24 to 48 hours).",negative
paying your bill was much easier on the automated system.,negative

After several agonizing minutes I think it's paid. No statement saying your bill has been paid, or even a thank you, but when I closed out and returned, It showed a balance of zero. I have determined that it is easier to spend about $1.50 in gas and stamps and drive to the post office to mail the paper bill.",negative

"app keeps getting worse. dont know how to access my account anymore, just takes me to an att advertisement sales website with no log in access.",negative
I have not been able to pay my bill online thru the AT&T app for 3 months. I put in my code and it says system error and try back later Very frustrating.,negative

we will are yu5,negative

"I just want to be able to log into my account. But instead the app is full of ads for the features and phones one gets if they sign up for a new plan. I don't need to be advertised to, I already have a plan. Your intended audience doesn't have this app and your customers can't pay through the app. I can't find the account login anymore, the app is now worthless.",negative
"Even after the latest update you have to start the app, close it and start it again to see your current data usage. Every single time.",negative
poor,negative

"this is the worst experience I have ever had with an app. i keep getting messages that my user name and password are incorrect, even when they send them to me I still get the same messages. Then when asked to answer security questions, it isn't even the ones i had set for my account. Total waste of time. very poor job for an app.",negative
difficult to use. didn't allow cell bill to be paid,negative
This app is a nice thought with a bunch of avenues for various features all in one place but just about every selection requires a 60+ second loading time which will test the patience of even the most patient customers.,positive
has only gotten worse. for years it has taken a ridiculously long time to do anything on the app. now with this latest incarnation ut takes a solid 5 minutes or more just to get the login screen to open.,negative
not working,negative
"Just trying to look at my bill and see tracking on an order I have placed, I have had to reset my password, been looped around from one page back to another, and have found the spot to get tracking, but it will not show the information. This app is worthless.",negative
it wont let me sign in. always says system error 😡.... whats the point of having service through At&t. im going to switch providers. I rather have four lines under 100$. thanks for nothing.,negative
For no known reason I suddenly cannot make a payment by scanning a check. Cannot for the life of me find any help anywhere in the AT&T app. App is updated. Too frustrating.,negative
Difficult,negative
"""Excuse our dust""",negative
rarely works,negative
"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. As others have said, the one I thing I use the app for (view and pay my bill) doesn't work! FIX THE TOP TAB so I can at least get to ""My AT&T"" from My AT&T. Ridiculous, It's an obvious attempt to get people who already are customers, to shop and spend. It's been ""broken"" since it rolled out over a month ago. It must be pretty hard to add or fix a link. It's not like links have been around since the dawn of the internet.... Oh wait, they have. Shame on you AT&T.",negative
"I hate AT&T! Now that they have taken over DirecTV, I have been locked out of my account, the app is a joke and doesn't work! I called them and they couldn't help me. They stopped mailing my bill so I have to call to get my balance and make a payment, plus pay $5 for a "" Convenience Fee"". Nothing about AT&T is convenient! I want my Dish Network back!!!",negative

"terrible app, slow, glitchy and totally unexpected from a technology company, angry birds works better",negative
app sucks. had to use wifi to leave this review. but im still getting charged for service every day,negative
I once would have given this 5 stars. I loved using it for bill pay. But recently I can no longer access my joined wireless account. I have called customer service who were unable to do anything to fix the issue and in fact told me to call a nonexistent number to fix the issue. Since I can no longer use it for what I need the most on any device it is doing nothing but taking up space. I will admit I miss being able to use this app for paying my bills and checking usages.,negative
"Worthless. The previous app worked, and they had to screw it up.",negative
"Slow to load, difficult to navigate, and rife with bugs.",negative
sometimes I can't login to my account,negative

"Been trying to log into this for days and get an Error every time. Another example of updating something that didnt need updated. Says ""Try Again in 60 mins"". After dozens of ""60 mins"" later, still useless! You say it's been ""Fixed"", no it hasn't.",negative
Temporarily unavailable.,negative

new update has rendered the app useless on my phone. i hate it. it wasnt much before but it worked (kinda),negative
"not optimized for wireless home internet. keeps suggesting i upgrade my ZTE 4g modem to a new phone which doesnt even support my plan. also the data usage shown is never up to date so im always over what it says, leading me to overage charges ""10g for an additional $25 whether i want it or not"". no option to halt data usage when i use up my data. it is impossible to use the 100g a month i pay for without going over. i have to shut it off before i even get close. its a costly scam. fix please.",negative

Junk App. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice and the app still won't open. Quitting AT&T asap. I don't have autopay set up but they somehow charged my card 20$ over my total bill due and over drafted my account. Fed up and switching to Sling.,negative

"the app hardly ""works"". most of the buttons dont function and the app has constant problems. Almost seems like they engineered it to be a hassle to pay your bill on time.",negative
App has been down for weeks,negative
"This app is miserable to use. After every update there is a ridiculous amount of effort required to log on. It takes so long to load that it times out and kicks you all the way out. Force Stop, Disable, Enable, reenter all credentials- all have to be done multiple times and even then you are lucky to get on. The platform changes at will so you never know what hoops you will have to jump through once you are able to successfully log on. Once you are able to get in, navigation causes it to lock up.",negative

it keeps kicking me out,negative
"DirecTV tries to force you to download this garbage app to make a payment by telling you theres a fee to pay over the phone. That's a lie! There's a free automated system. AT&T is literally one of the worst companies continually that I've dealt with, if not the worst. It's between them and Spectrum...but I'd probably have to say I've had more problems and more terrible customer service with AT&T over the years. So excited that I have now cancelled my DirecTV and have made my last payment!!!",negative

I have been trying to pay my bill for 3 or 4 days now. It won't let me sign in. It says try later not working or even that my password doesn't exist. I've changed my password 2 or 3 times now and right after it confirms and verifies it and I go to sign in it will then say invalid password. I've had this password for over a year and had to change it for no reason as it didn't help me to access my acct. Maybe they'll make an extra million on everyone getting a late fee.,negative
Very confusing and difficult to use. Rarely works well for me.,negative

Slow app... takes forever to load... on Wi-Fi too",negative
"I was happy with the service and the assistance when we have hit a difficult situation in life. Now with whatever changes you have done, has made it to where I could not make any adjustments. So now a return fee might be due to the funds not being available. My daughter was having a situation which caused her to get late. Due to my health I have missed a few days at work and was not paid.

cant even load it's own app without wifi let alone any apps with at&t,negative
"for some reason the ""my at&t"" app is not working. It lets me sign in and then takes me to an error page and doesnt load anything. this has been down for a few months now and i been patient waiting in it to fix, thinking it was an update or something. typically i use this app because its way easier to pay my bill and look at other services.",negative
cant even log in to my account. yet another crappy att service,negative
Terrible app. I can't get to my account to pay my bill because it doesn't do anything when I click on what should be the link that takes me to the view and pay bills page. I've had trouble logging in repeatedly. and had to change passwords twice because it said I wasn't authorized. I guess I won't pay my bill and when they call to get paid I'll tell them why I can't pay.,negative
will not update,negative
"Cannot access account, says does not recognize password. When password is reset it tells me my account is locked. Was on the phone with ATT for nearly 2 hours this morning and The issue was NOT fixed nor do I have access to my account.",negative
has a hard time loading takes forever to go from page to page can never remember a password and doesn't work 25% of the time,negative
It was fine the way it was. After the recent redesign I can no longer access my account. Garbage.,negative
It never works right . Im.uninstalling fix it please. Its very annoying,negative
user un-friendly,negative
I can no longer access my account through the app. it has now become nothing more than an AT&T advertisement app. very disappointed.,negative
Update is still absolute trash. I still can't make payments and had to use my browser to make a payment.,negative
Can't access my account. Account menu isn't even there anymore.,negative
all I wanted to do is pay my bill,negative
This apps always have issues. One min you can pay your bill The next min you can't do anything .,negative
I really cant make changes to my accounts like I thought & directv customer service has really decline..,negative
"not working, again....",negative
"They updated the app and now you can't login to your account. you can click on My Account all you want, it's just for decoration. AT&T products and services suck!",negative
"horrifically slow, buggy app. Like all things AT&T, this app sits on top of their patchwork of poorly stitched together back-end services. So, if you like failed auth attempts, unavailable services, endless spinning load graphics, erroneous behavior, circular navigation... you've come to the right place. Ironically, I can't tell if the sub-par behavior of this worthless app is due to the app itself, or AT&T's horrible cell service/wireless, both of which I regret signing up for.",negative
I have never been able to get to the website using this app!,positive
AT&T owns fake news CNN 👎 I will switch over to Verizon.,negative
Since latest update can not make payments. Sets in infinite loop saying hang on almost there.,negative
The format change was dumb and unnecessary. Overly complicated and not user friendly,negative
i hate this website/app i never can get signed in on my account,negative
"Useless app, rarely works. Usually as ureliable as Uverse",negative
"I at my age once I had it now put it back,you're nosey if you want to be looking at photos camp pictures I had downloaded my AT&T account I'm not going to redo it put it back like it was no privacy there's no more room on my phone the cost is constantly putting stuff on there this is my phone is stepping over too many boundaries I don't have enough room on my phone to put what I want on it so don't you erase everything that I have because I end up and delete some of your things",negative
the changes make it nearly impossible to pay my bill. it makes me want to leave AT&T for good,negative
"I liked the new look of the app but with the latest update it is back to what it was before. Plain, slow and difficult to navigate.",negative
"Was used to the old app, and the new one has prompted me multiple times to ""log-in"" when I have already logged in using the biometric feature on my phone, frustrating.",negative
if there was a negative star that would be this app,negative
"I don't know what you have done to your app, but I just wasted 30 minutes trying to pay my bill and got NOWHERE!!! First, after waiting several minutes for the app to never load my account, I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Then, it refused to accept my username/password, so I went through the rigmarole of changing both. After all of that, your app STILL wouldn't load my account!!! All I want to do is pay my bill. Now I'll have to go to a store. You should give me a discount for the aggravation.",negative
"Whatever you did with this latest update has broken the app for me. I'm unable to access my account now. It asks me to confirm my password but there is no place to enter the password. Not to mention that I've been using my fingerprint as my ID for the last several months with no issue. Now, it still asks for the finger print confirmation when I open the app. The finger print is confirmed, then I'm stuck. Nothing else works after that. Funny thing is I'm trying to access it so I can pay my bill.",negative
"it sucks, never loads and errors out!",negative
"it's moving faster! yay! forever it has been the slowest, most frustrating thing...I hope it keeps up and I will bump up more stars",negative
doesnt work for me any more,negative
I'm always having to call to reset passwords ...randomly it just stops accepting my finger print or password. Very frustrating!,negative
when I want to see my bill I have wait for it to come up usually in 20 mins. it's not my internet cause I'm using wifi,negative
"I can't access my account through the app anymore. All the other links work, but not the account. This app is now useless.",negative
This new app is ridiculous everytime I'm trying to get into my account it's not letting me. I can be tapping all day and I still cant get in to my account. This is pure foolishness and I'm not happy what so ever.,negative
I think it's junk and bloatware and is a hassle to use. It takes an excessive amount of time for every single page to load and when it finally does load its a chore to find the information you need.,negative
bad a service is,positive
app will not work says oops problem on our end try again later. for the past month,negative
doesnt work on my Samsung s8...wouldnt go in to mys bills and only way I can log in is threw a iPhone to pay my bills,negative
Not able to log on. Tried several times even with the help of a customer service representative. I do not recommend this app.,negative

home phone with internet can't get data usage,negative
"mediocre, unreliable, it doesn't even compare with verizon",negative

Will not let me log in on mobile.,negative
2 months and app still will NOT OPEN....ERROR ERROR all I get. piece of carp app. and app came with the phone! maybe at&t will fix it...lol,negative
not easy to navigate. also gives mistakes information. plus the company itself won't help you either. and just wait till you try to upgrade your phone.,negative
app isn't working for me. once you click something it just keeps loading and never loads.,negative
Terrible as is their normal website. I guess when you have AT&T you should just have lowered expectations,negative
"this was after the update...my info was not updated after i paid my bill. it still says the previous amount, in which was already paid.",negative
sucks,negative
I want to change my password but not by having it sent to my house. I want it sent to my phone so I van pay my stupid bill,negative
runs extremely slow and always freezes.,negative
Can't log in,negative
if I could I would give it a .5 of a star due to the fact that everything time I'm on the App And try to log in it tells me that my password is not correct and then I have to make a new a whole new password that I save to the app and the next time I open the app it does the same thing... now I'm trying to pay my Internet bill and my old Direct TV account that I closed last year keeps popping up and won't let me pay my Internet bill,negative
horrible would like to have negative stars,negative
"this app is terrible. since the update, I cannot even login due to the 2 step ID verification. it does not send me a text with the code! even after talking with AT&T tech people 3 times and after they escalate, still doesn't work...I cant even login on a desktop. what up with that??",negative
I have been with AT&T for 15 years. But the last two years I have been trying to get a line from my old tablet off my bill. I have called I have talked to them and it was supposed to be twice off my bill. Me not checking the paperwork on my bill continue to pay the same mine. When I ask AT&T about it and try to get a refund for almost $400 that they have taken from me they refuse. They said they were open the case they denied me and never told me that they denied me. I call and that's how I found out that I was denied. I am very hurt and very upset to be with the company the 15 years or longer and to be treated this way. There's no one you can talk to besides the supervisors on the phone and they never solve my problem and now I feel like I may have to go to another phone company which I am very hurt and sad to leave AT&T but I cannot stay with them when they do things like this to me. Leaving old $400 but now they want me to pay 258 for a bill. They also put 12gb on my phone which I never signed up for they can never show me where I signed up for I only supposed to have 4 gigabytes they charge me for 12 and refuse to refund me.,negative
After the new update the app cannot be used unless you turn off wifi and use your data. Thankfully I read a review stating this or I would've never known. Hopefully this is fixed soon.,negative
"this is absolutely horrible!!! inaccurate, paid my bill and suddenly says my account is suspended! what the heck! pathetic",negative
AT&T was good until they constantly drop my calls and I had to wait an hour and a 1/2 and they charge you a month ahead and don't tell you,negative
PLEASE Fix it!!!!! I haven't been able to access my acct for a long while. Used to use it all the time. What is the deal???,negative
it won't let me sign in often. says something went wrong. doesnt tell you what did and just keeps not working,negative

"after the update, this app is worthless",negative
"horrible, it won't let me login to access my benefits. Get authentication error.",negative

My 911 calling area is still in another state that I moved from 7 months ago and I can't get it updated I just keep getting error messages so I called they said they do see any problems on their end and can't refund the other state taxes they billed me for. They don't value their customers and they steal from their customers. Cant wait till my phone is paid off so I can switch. Att is a joke.,negative

App sucks. can't login when connected via wifi.,negative
this new update sucks! cant pay my bills or check if my phone is eligible for upgrade or do ANYTHING pretty much cuz the app wont let me see my account! pretty much just stays on this store-like page where the only thing I can do is read an overview of what services and products you offer. GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS,negative

"Since the last update you can no longer even access your account. What is the point of sending me to the website to try to sell me things when I only want to log in to view my account? I've been a att customer for a decade and have a phone bill higher than most people's car payment, I do not need you to sell me something anytime I want to log in and check my account.",negative
App never works and when it does it is very slow. If I could give it negative stars I would. At&t doesn't care so this is pointless.,negative
"Prior to last few updates this was a great app. Now I have a lot of issues logging in and ""temporarily unavailable"" issues once logged in.",negative
